        <h1>Repairing your disk with PGP whole disk encryption (Mac)</h1><div><p>You’ve got your boot drive encrypted using PGP’s <a href="http://www.symantec.com/business/whole-disk-encryption">whole disk encryption</a>.  Great, you are security conscious feeling all safe and secure, but how do you fix file system errors and disk issues?<br/></p>

<p>In the past, you would boot off of your Mac OS install DVD and run Disk Utility.  If you do that now, you’ll kill your disk and won’t be able to boot anymore.  The problem is that the disk needs to be decrypted in order for you to repair the filesystem, but how can you do that with the install DVD?
 Short answer, you can’t.  Long answer, there is a way to repair your disk, but it will involve using a second drive in order to do it.  This post will walk you through how you can safely and quickly repair your encrypted boot drive.</p>

<p>You will need the following:</p>

<ul><li>Disk Utility (comes with your mac)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a></li>
<li>Extra USB or Firewire HD (I recommend a thumb drive)</li>
<li>15 gigs of free space</li>
</ul><p>First, you will need to install Mac OSX to the extra drive.  Do a minimal install to save space (if you are short on a space.)  You really only need the core OS.<br/></p>

<p>Second, boot off the extra drive into your newly installed OS and install all of the Apple updates by running “Software Update” from the Apple menu.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/SuperDuper%21.png" alt="SuperDuper in action"/></p>

<p>Third, install PGP.<br/></p>

<p>Now you’ve got a bootable version of Mac OS X with PGP installed.  If you ever want to check your drive for errors, just boot off the newly created disk, use PGP to unlock your drive, and then run Disk Utility to fix it.  I used a USB drive so I could carry it around with me in case I needed a quick fix on the road.</p></div>

Mac anti-theft software <a href="http://hiddenapp.com/">Hidden</a> is an additional security measure that will help you locate your notebook if it is stolen.   The software is part of a service that runs on your Mac and when activated (via a website) notifies you of its location and periodically snaps photos of the person using it.   I use a competing product called <a href="http://www.orbicule.com/undercover/mac/">Undercover</a> which luckily I haven’t needed to activate.</p>

<p>I think the best way to protect yourself is to protect your data.  Encrypt the contents of your hard disk, save offsite backups regularly, and when traveling, keep your notebook out of sight.<br/></p></div>

        <h1>How to enable FTP uploads to Amazon S3</h1><div><p>There are many apps which allow you to upload an image to a server which can then be inserted into content.  I keep my images on Amazon S3 storage because of the cost/space benefits.  Many of these apps support ftp but not Amazon S3 leaving me with the added burden of manually copying my images to their destination.</p>
<p>I recently started using myTumblr to create my Tumblr content and wanted to use it with Amazon S3, but it only supports ftp.  No problem, I’ll improvise.</p>
<p>I’m a Mac user so I know that I’ve got built in ftp support.  Great, I’ll enable that</p>
<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1292260590.jpg" alt="myTumblr Image"/></p>
<p>I go into my System Preferences, Sharing and then choose File Sharing and options.  I check the FTP option.  Make sure ftp is enabled.  Now create a folder to host those images on your local machine.  I chose something under:</p>
<p><code>~/Sites/joshkerr.com/images/</code></p>
<p>You cold also enable SSH and then use SFTP (which is what I did,) but that is entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Next, I need a way to sync those files up to Amazon S3.  For more advanced users, you can just write a shell script and use FolderActions to trigger it.  For less advanced users, I recommend using Transmit by Panic.  It has an Automator action that is very easy to setup.</p>
<p>Load up Automator and choose a new folder action.  Then set it up like so:</p>
<p><img width="500" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1292260825.jpg" alt="myTumblr Image"/></p>
<p>Make sure to choose the folder you created in the previous step to execute the folder action on.  Also be sure to choose the right Amazon S3 folder.  At the end, when you copy a new image into this folder, you want to trigger it to launch Transmit and sync the folder.</p>
<p>Next you will need to make sure you have cloud font support enabled on Amazon S3.  This will give you a public URL that you can use that will be consistent for each image you upload to S3.</p>
<p>If you are a bit more sophisticated, you can use a shell script to sync the files.  This has the added benefit of being a background operation.  I would still use Automator and folder actions to set it up, but this time around, do something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Automator%20with%20shell%20script.png"><img width="500" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Automator%20with%20shell%20script.png" alt="Automator with shell script"/></a></p>
<p>I used a ruby script called s3sync to handle the actual syncing.  I am not going to cover the installation of that utility in this article.</p>
<p>The last step is to configure your app to support the new ftp site.  For me, I’m using myTumblr so I configure it like so:</p>
<p><img width="500" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1292261061.jpg" alt="myTumblr Image"/></p>
<p>Make sure to enter your cloud front URL instead of mine.  If everything is configured correctly, when a new image is added to the images folder it should launch a sync on Transmit.  The side effect of this unfortunately is that Transmit will open a new window in the foreground interrupting your workflow.  Still, it saves a bunch of steps that would otherwise complicate something that should be simple.</p></div>

        <h1>Video tagging automation with iFlicks and Hazel</h1><div><p>The latest beta version of iFlicks will transcode HD versions of mkv files into iTunes compatible mp4 files without re-encoding the video.  With this and Hazel, a Mac automation app, I’ve got an automated way of converting and tagging my video files.</p>

<p>First, you need to download the beta version of iFlicks.  You can get it from the iFlicks <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/iflicks/topics">Google group</a>.  Just search around and you’ll find the link.</p>

<p>Now that iFlicks is installed, you’ll need to download and install Hazel.  You can get it from <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now you’ll need to configure your Hazel rules.  Lets pretend that you use a program like <a href="http://www.sabnzbd.org">SABNzbd</a> to download TV shows or Movies (non copyrighted of course) from the Internet.  I would normally have them in either my Movie or TV folder depending on the type.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Finder.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Finder.png" alt="Finder"/></a></p>

<p>Now we can configure Hazel to automatically load our mkv files into iFlicks and clean up the folders when it is done.  This is what my list of rules looks like for my Movies folder.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Hazel%20Window.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Hazel%20Window.png" alt="Hazel Window"/></a></p>

<p>I’ve got three rules that you’ll need to create:

</p>

<ul><li>Encode Video - loads the mkv file into iFlicks for encoding and tagging</li>
<li>Delete NFO files - this cleans out the directory from the left over garbage leaving an empty folder</li>
<li>Process sub folders - this will go into sub folders and run the previous two rules.  If the folder is empty it will delete it</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Encode%20Video.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Encode%20Video.png" alt="Encode Video"/></a></p>

<p>The encode video rule first looks for a file over 500mb that ends in mkv.  It also checks that it does not have a color label.  This is important as the label signifies that a video is being procoessed.  Since processing can take several minutes, you don’t want Hazel to keep adding the same video to iFlicks.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Delete%20info%20files.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Delete%20info%20files.png" alt="Delete info files"/></a></p>

<p>The delete NFO files rule just removes the meaningless files left over after processing the video.  When done I should have an empty folder.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Remove%20subfolders.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Remove%20subfolders.png" alt="Remove subfolders"/></a></p>

<p>The process subfolders rule does two things.  First it dives into subfolders and runs the previous two rules.  Second it looks for empty folders and runs a script to delete them. </p>

<p><code>
tell application "Finder"<br/>
  set theContents to entire contents of theFile<br/>
  if theContents = {} then<br/>
   delete theFile<br/>
  end if<br/>
end tell
</code></p>

<p>If you configure your TV folder to run the same way, you’ll end up with an automated way to process your downloaded mkv files using Hazel and iFlicks.  It took me a while to finally come up with a reliable automated solution.  I’d like to see iFlicks handle most of this without the need for using Hazel, but for now this is working pretty well.</p></div>

        <h1>Do you encrypt your hard drive?  PGP vs FileVault</h1><div><p>I just got done with encrypting my notebook’s 500GB  hard drive.  It took a little over 6 hours to for PGP to encrypt the whole drive.  I have a Mac so I had the option to use FileVault the built in encryption service, but chose instead to use PGP.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pgp.png" alt="Encrypting my hard drive"/><br/><br/>For me, the big differentiator is that FileVault only encrypts your home folder.  There are so many ways that data can get outside your home folder and that is a glaring security hole. <br/><br/>These are the advantages to PGP Whole Disk Encryption over FileVault: </p>

<ul><li>Time Machine Backup’s run whilst user is logged into home folder.</li>
<li>You get some extra tools (eg to encrypt external drives.)</li>
<li>You don’t need to worry about sensitive data getting outside of the home folder.</li>
<li>You can use the computer while the disk is encrypting.</li>
<li>Your swap file and sleep image are encrypted automatically.</li>
<li>No extra waiting during shutdown for FileVault optimizations.</li>
</ul><p>The big advantage of FileVault over PGP WDE is that FileVault is an Apple created technology and will be compatible with future versions of Mac OS X where PGP might not.  Recently users who upgraded to 10.6.5 found their computers unable to boot due to a last minute change made by Apple before the release.  PGP was quick to fix the issue and nobody lost data, but the thought of waiting for a rescue boot disk to use your notebook again is pretty scary.</p>

<p>I consider myself a power user and I was initially worried about performance.  WDE is not supposed to cause any noticeable performance hit to your notebook in normal usage.  (What ever that means.)  For me, I notice that the startup times are a bit longer, but everything else is just as zippy fast as it was before WDE.</p>

<p>I travel quite a bit and feel reassured that my notebook is protected especially in the event of a theft.  If you have the extra cash, I recommend PGP Whole Disk Encryption over using FileVault as it provides a much more secure way to keep your data safe.</p></div>

        <h1>Google Chrome Web Store</h1><div><p>Google released its Chrome Web Store today and I have to admit, I think they are on to something.  I think one of the major shortcomings with web apps is that they run in a browser and the general consensous of users is that they are pages, not apps.  They can’t retain state, they have to be refreshed, and they crash and loose data often.</p>

<p>All of this is untrue if you are building web apps in HTMl5.  But the general population doesn’t know it.  So why not create a web app store.  This instills confidence in the user that the pages are actually apps and that they will behave like apps.  I think Google did a good job with its version of the app store. </p>

<p>I’m a regular Chrome users so I’ll make good use it if.</p>

        <h1>Repairing your disk with PGP whole disk encryption (Mac)</h1><div><p>You&#8217;ve got your boot drive encrypted using PGP’s <a href="http://www.symantec.com/business/whole-disk-encryption">whole disk encryption</a>.  Great, you are security conscious feeling all safe and secure, but how do you fix file system errors and disk issues?<br/></p>

<p>In the past, you would boot off of your Mac OS install DVD and run Disk Utility.  If you do that now, you&#8217;ll kill your disk and won’t be able to boot anymore.  The problem is that the disk needs to be decrypted in order for you to repair the filesystem, but how can you do that with the install DVD?
 Short answer, you can’t.  Long answer, there is a way to repair your disk, but it will involve using a second drive in order to do it.  This post will walk you through how you can safely and quickly repair your encrypted boot drive.</p>

<p>You will need the following:</p>

<ul><li>Disk Utility (comes with your mac)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a></li>
<li>Extra USB or Firewire HD (I recommend a thumb drive)</li>
<li>15 gigs of free space</li>
</ul><p>First, you will need to install Mac OSX to the extra drive.  Do a minimal install to save space (if you are short on a space.)  You really only need the core OS.<br/></p>

<p>Second, boot off the extra drive into your newly installed OS and install all of the Apple updates by running “Software Update” from the Apple menu.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/SuperDuper%21.png" alt="SuperDuper in action"/></p>

<p>Third, install PGP.<br/></p>

<p>Now you&#8217;ve got a bootable version of Mac OS X with PGP installed.  If you ever want to check your drive for errors, just boot off the newly created disk, use PGP to unlock your drive, and then run Disk Utility to fix it.  I used a USB drive so I could carry it around with me in case I needed a quick fix on the road.</p></div>

Mac anti-theft software <a href="http://hiddenapp.com/">Hidden</a> is an additional security measure that will help you locate your notebook if it is stolen.   The software is part of a service that runs on your Mac and when activated (via a website) notifies you of its location and periodically snaps photos of the person using it.   I use a competing product called <a href="http://www.orbicule.com/undercover/mac/">Undercover</a> which luckily I haven’t needed to activate.</p>

<p>I think the best way to protect yourself is to protect your data.  Encrypt the contents of your hard disk, save offsite backups regularly, and when traveling, keep your notebook out of sight.<br/></p></div>

        <h1>How to enable FTP uploads to Amazon S3</h1><div><p>There are many apps which allow you to upload an image to a server which can then be inserted into content.  I keep my images on Amazon S3 storage because of the cost/space benefits.  Many of these apps support ftp but not Amazon S3 leaving me with the added burden of manually copying my images to their destination.</p>
<p>I recently started using myTumblr to create my Tumblr content and wanted to use it with Amazon S3, but it only supports ftp.  No problem, I&#8217;ll improvise.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a Mac user so I know that I&#8217;ve got built in ftp support.  Great, I&#8217;ll enable that</p>
<p><img alt="myTumblr Image" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1292260590.jpg"/></p>
<p>I go into my System Preferences, Sharing and then choose File Sharing and options.  I check the FTP option.  Make sure ftp is enabled.  Now create a folder to host those images on your local machine.  I chose something under:</p>
<p><code>~/Sites/joshkerr.com/images/</code></p>
<p>You cold also enable SSH and then use SFTP (which is what I did,) but that is entirely up to you.</p>
<p>Next, I need a way to sync those files up to Amazon S3.  For more advanced users, you can just write a shell script and use FolderActions to trigger it.  For less advanced users, I recommend using Transmit by Panic.  It has an Automator action that is very easy to setup.</p>
<p>Load up Automator and choose a new folder action.  Then set it up like so:</p>
<p><img alt="myTumblr Image" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1292260825.jpg"/></p>
<p>Make sure to choose the folder you created in the previous step to execute the folder action on.  Also be sure to choose the right Amazon S3 folder.  At the end, when you copy a new image into this folder, you want to trigger it to launch Transmit and sync the folder.</p>
<p>Next you will need to make sure you have cloud font support enabled on Amazon S3.  This will give you a public URL that you can use that will be consistent for each image you upload to S3.</p>
<p>If you are a bit more sophisticated, you can use a shell script to sync the files.  This has the added benefit of being a background operation.  I would still use Automator and folder actions to set it up, but this time around, do something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Automator%20with%20shell%20script.png"><img alt="Automator with shell script" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Automator%20with%20shell%20script.png"/></a></p>
<p>I used a ruby script called s3sync to handle the actual syncing.  I am not going to cover the installation of that utility in this article.</p>
<p>The last step is to configure your app to support the new ftp site.  For me, I&#8217;m using myTumblr so I configure it like so:</p>
<p><img alt="myTumblr Image" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1292261061.jpg"/></p>
<p>Make sure to enter your cloud front URL instead of mine.  If everything is configured correctly, when a new image is added to the images folder it should launch a sync on Transmit.  The side effect of this unfortunately is that Transmit will open a new window in the foreground interrupting your workflow.  Still, it saves a bunch of steps that would otherwise complicate something that should be simple.</p></div>

        <h1>Video tagging automation with iFlicks and Hazel </h1><div><p>The latest beta version of iFlicks will transcode HD versions of mkv files into iTunes compatible mp4 files without re-encoding the video.  With this and Hazel, a Mac automation app, I&#8217;ve got an automated way of converting and tagging my video files.</p>

<p>First, you need to download the beta version of iFlicks.  You can get it from the iFlicks <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/iflicks/topics">Google group</a>.  Just search around and you&#8217;ll find the link.</p>

<p>Now that iFlicks is installed, you&#8217;ll need to download and install Hazel.  You can get it from <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now you&#8217;ll need to configure your Hazel rules.  Lets pretend that you use a program like <a href="http://www.sabnzbd.org">SABNzbd</a> to download TV shows or Movies (non copyrighted of course) from the Internet.  I would normally have them in either my Movie or TV folder depending on the type.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Finder.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Finder.png" alt="Finder"/></a></p>

<p>Now we can configure Hazel to automatically load our mkv files into iFlicks and clean up the folders when it is done.  This is what my list of rules looks like for my Movies folder.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Hazel%20Window.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Hazel%20Window.png" alt="Hazel Window"/></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got three rules that you&#8217;ll need to create: 

</p><ul><li>Encode Video - loads the mkv file into iFlicks for encoding and tagging</li>
<li>Delete NFO files - this cleans out the directory from the left over garbage leaving an empty folder</li>
<li>Process sub folders - this will go into sub folders and run the previous two rules.  If the folder is empty it will delete it</li>
</ul><p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Encode%20Video.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Encode%20Video.png" alt="Encode Video"/></a></p>

<p>The encode video rule first looks for a file over 500mb that ends in mkv.  It also checks that it does not have a color label.  This is important as the label signifies that a video is being procoessed.  Since processing can take several minutes, you don&#8217;t want Hazel to keep adding the same video to iFlicks.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Delete%20info%20files.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Delete%20info%20files.png" alt="Delete info files"/></a></p>

<p>The delete NFO files rule just removes the meaningless files left over after processing the video.  When done I should have an empty folder.</p>

<p>The process subfolders rule does two things.  First it dives into subfolders and runs the previous two rules.  Second it looks for empty folders and runs a script to delete them. </p>

<p><code>
tell application "Finder"<br/>
  set theContents to entire contents of theFile<br/>
  if theContents = {} then<br/>
   delete theFile<br/>
  end if<br/>
end tell
</code></p>

<p>If you configure your TV folder to run the same way, you&#8217;ll end up with an automated way to process your downloaded mkv files using Hazel and iFlicks.  It took me a while to finally come up with a reliable automated solution.  I&#8217;d like to see iFlicks handle most of this without the need for using Hazel, but for now this is working pretty well.</p></div>

        <h1>Do you encrypt your hard drive?  PGP vs FileVault</h1><div><p>I just got done with encrypting my notebook&#8217;s 500GB  hard drive.  It took a little over 6 hours to for PGP to encrypt the whole drive.  I have a Mac so I had the option to use FileVault the built in encryption service, but chose instead to use PGP.</p>
<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pgp.png" alt="Encrypting my hard drive"/><br/><br/>For me, the big differentiator is that FileVault only encrypts your home folder.  There are so many ways that data can get outside your home folder and that is a glaring security hole. <br/><br/>These are the advantages to PGP Whole Disk Encryption over FileVault: </p>
<ul><li>Time Machine Backup&#8217;s run whilst user is logged into home folder.</li>
<li>You get some extra tools (eg to encrypt external drives.)</li>
<li>You don&#8217;t need to worry about sensitive data getting outside of the home folder.</li>
<li>You can use the computer while the disk is encrypting.</li>
<li>Your swap file and sleep image are encrypted automatically.</li>
<li>No extra waiting during shutdown for FileVault optimizations.</li>
</ul><p>The big advantage of FileVault over PGP WDE is that FileVault is an Apple created technology and will be compatible with future versions of Mac OS X where PGP might not.  Recently users who upgraded to 10.6.5 found their computers unable to boot due to a last minute change made by Apple before the release.  PGP was quick to fix the issue and nobody lost data, but the thought of waiting for a rescue boot disk to use your notebook again is pretty scary.</p>
<p>I consider myself a power user and I was initially worried about performance.  WDE is not supposed to cause any noticeable performance hit to your notebook in normal usage.  (What ever that means.)  For me, I notice that the startup times are a bit longer, but everything else is just as zippy fast as it was before WDE.</p>
<p>I travel quite a bit and feel reassured that my notebook is protected especially in the event of a theft.  If you have the extra cash, I recommend PGP Whole Disk Encryption over using FileVault as it provides a much more secure way to keep your data safe.</p></div>

        <h1>Google Chrome Web Store</h1><div><p>Google released its Chrome Web Store today and I have to admit, I think they are on to something.  I think one of the major shortcomings with web apps is that they run in a browser and the general consensous of users is that they are pages, not apps.  They can&#8217;t retain state, they have to be refreshed, and they crash and loose data often.</p>
<p>All of this is untrue if you are building web apps in HTMl5.  But the general population doesn&#8217;t know it.  So why not create a web app store.  This instills confidence in the user that the pages are actually apps and that they will behave like apps.  I think Google did a good job with its version of the app store. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m a regular Chrome users so I&#8217;ll make good use it if.</p>
