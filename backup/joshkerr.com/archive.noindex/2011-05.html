        <h1>Tech Tool Pro now allows bootable partition</h1><div><p>Tech Tool Pro is a long time leader in Mac repair and diagnostics.  It used to be bundled with new Mac purchases as part of the Apple Care warranty.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6pDCK.jpg" alt="TechTool"/></p>

<p>One of the best features in the product is its ability to boot from a DVD and repair your system.  Ever since the release of EFI firmware Macs, the bootable DVD hasn&#8217;t worked.  Now, with the release of Tech Tool Pro version 6, you can create an e-drive bootable partition on your Mac and repair without needing a DVD.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t tried it yet, but its the logical next step in bootable diagnostics, especially considering the future of computing doesn&#8217;t have an optical media drive.  Take for instance that new Macbook Airs come with media on a USB stick.</p>

<p>I can see problems with the bootable partition scheme though.  What if you need to repair the drive with the bootable partition?  Maybe you boot off a clone on an external drive?</p>

<p>Also new with Tech Tool Pro 6 is a cloning feature.  I&#8217;m a big fan of cloning, it keeps a fully working disk on hand so that if I do have a failure, I can boot in seconds off the clone and keep on working.</p>

<p>I bought a copy of Tech Tool 6 and plan to take it through its paces.</p></div>

        <h1>The crash of Air France flight 447 (Mystery)</h1><div><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vcD4J.jpg" alt="Airfrance"/></p>

<p>News outlets recently published the contents of the black box from the ill fated Air France flight 447 that crashed into the ocean after mysteriously dropping out of the sky.  The news reported that the cause of the crash was related to ice formed on sensors that measure airspeed.  Case closed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/447730-af447-wreckage-found-27.html">PPRuNE</a> is a professional pilots rumor network and it has a great  forum where pilots discuss issues like the Air France 447 crash.  The opinions from these professional pilots seem to indicate that the mystery is far from over.</p>

<p>Several pilots bring into question the actions of the seasoned flight screw whose actions go against not only their training but common sense.  For example, one pilot discusses the fact that the Air France co-pilot kept the plane in a nose up position even though the plane was clearly stalled.  Doing so would only make the stall worse.  Not only were the alarms ringining in the cockpit, but you could feel the vibrations of the stall.</p>

<p>From a pilot on the forums:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I&#8217;m rather disturbed that far from applying the pitch/power memory items, he chose to pitch up instead whilst encountering STALL warnings no less!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And another:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don&#8217;t see why the AP pitched UP due to reducing airspeed. Worse still, it seems clear to me that the pilots had several STALL warnings after AP disengagement and prior to it actually dropping like a brick. What is even more perplexing is given that the pilot arrested the 7000 ft rate of climb, why he then proceeded to apply aft stick input and raise the nose?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that the case is far from over.</p></div>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/moGyg.jpg" alt="BlurryWoman"/></p>

<p>If you lived through the 80&#8217;s and early 90&#8217;s, you would know that analog cable boxes distorted the adult channels if you didn&#8217;t subscribe to them.  So when you&#8217;d try and watch Playboy, you&#8217;d get the audio, but a really blurry picture like the one above.  Ahh, the memories.</p></div>

        <h1>Nice Tumblr workflow for the ruby user</h1><div><p>I&#8217;ve got a new workflow to submit posts to Tumblr.  When I&#8217;m not using <a href="http://www.cortexapp.com">Cortex</a>, I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/ia-writer-for-mac/">iA Writer</a> and a ruby script to send my content to Tumblr without even opening a web browser.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cortexapp.com">Cortex</a> is great for resubmitting other user&#8217;s content via the web, but when it comes to writing your own articles, forget it.  This is where <a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/ia-writer-for-mac/">iA Writer</a> comes in.  This app is designed for writing, it allows you to focus on the words (think full screen editor) and it has great markdown support.</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t easily submit articles from a text editor (unless you&#8217;ve rigged up support in Textmate) so you need to setup a script to send your posts for you.  Here is mine:</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/bash
IFS=$(echo -en "\n\b")
cd "~/Dropbox/Blog/BlogArticles/"
set `ls -t -r | tail -n 1`
echo "$1"
tumblr -c ~/.tumblrlogin "$1"
</pre>

<p>I&#8217;m using a ruby gem: &#8212;tumblr-rb&#8212; and have it setup with my Tumblr blogs username and password in my ~/.tumblrlogin file.  More on the gem&#8217;s man pages about configuring the gem.</p>

<p>The script is simple.  It looks for the most recent post in my blog article directory and submits it.  In my post, I&#8217;ve got YAML config items that allow me to control where the post goes: queue, drafts, published, etc..</p>

<pre>
title: post title
type: regular
format: markdown
state: published
tags: tag1,tag2,tag3
</pre>

<p>So I write and save the posts in my blog directory and then execute my script to send them up to Tumblr.  If I wanted I could rig the script to open the browser and go right to the post (the ruby gem returns the post ID after a successful post.)</p>

<p>I could do a lot more with it, but for now it is getting the job done.</p></div>

        <h1>Japan shows it has a lot of class</h1><div><p>The US donated a ton of support to help the Japanese after the recent earthquake and tsunami.  So what does Japan do after the devestating tornado strikes in Joplin?  They send $120,000 in relief supplies to the people of Alabama.  It is a classy move and one that shows the stength of the relationship between Japan and the US.  Nicely done.</p>

        <h1>Did you delete your iTunes paid content accidentally?</h1><div><p>Consider this senario.  You&#8217;ve spent over $400 buying content from the iTunes store.  Videos, music, apps all delivered to your computer&#8217;s hard drive via a one time download.  Then, the unexpected happens.  Its all gone.  Somehow you lost your content.  Maybe it was hard drive failure, maybe your kid accidentally deleted the folder to make room to install Portal 2.  Either way, it is gone.</p>

<p>So what do you do?  Don&#8217;t fear, Apple will let you download it again.  Simply go to the iTunes support page, fill out a support ticket and explain the situation.  They will re-queue all of your paid content so that the next time you load iTunes, you&#8217;ll have your $400 worth of downloads waiting to go.</p>

<p>Even with this nice recovery options from a very generous Apple, I still recommend backing up your content.  For me its a combination of Drobo with Time Machine and an offsite Amazon S3 account via Jungle Disk.</p></div>

        <h1>Switch to VIM?</h1><div><p>I&#8217;m a big fan of <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> and use it for any and all text editing on the Mac. It is a powerful editor with a big community of users who contribute useful scripts to extend its capabilities. <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> is very much a <em>normal</em> editor and something that you can use with not much of a learning curve.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6VEXb.png" alt="VIM Editor"/></p>

<p>I have a few colleagues who use VIM, but the few times I&#8217;ve tried it I ended up uninstalling it because it is WAY too complicated.  It goes against everything that I&#8217;ve been doing for the past 20 years.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve become more and more envious of those that use VIM and the awesome power it has to make seemly complicated tasks seem simple.  I decided to try it out for a week and see if I can latch on.</p>

<p>About 10 years ago I decided to stop drinking coffee with lots of sugar and milk and instead drink it black.  It took me two weeks of drinking black coffee before I started to prefer it that way.   Now, I can&#8217;t imagine coffee any other way.</p>

<p>Using the cold turkey approach, I am now going to start using VIM exclusively as my text editor.  I refuse to launch <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> for anything, instead I&#8217;m going to clumsily navigate my way through VIM.  By the end of two weeks I should either be signing its praises or furious about my lost of productivity.  I&#8217;m guessing the former.</p>

<p><a href="http://macvim.org/">MacVim</a> seems to be the logical choice for VIM on the Mac.  It is a true cocoa Mac app wrapper for VIM and seems to incorporate a lot of Mac like features into it.  For example, cmd-s to save.  I&#8217;m also using a VIM distro of plugins and scripts called <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> which gives me a really quick and easy way to configure VIM with the most popular options.  <a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus">Janus</a> is distributed on Github making it very easy to update it as more features and fixes are introduced.</p>

<p>This article was not edited with VIM, but I promise the next one will be.</p></div>

        <h1>I&#039;m 37 and I still like Legos.</h1><div><p>I&#8217;ve got two young kids, a 6 year old girl and a 3 year old boy.  I was recently at the Lego store in my local mall with my kids buying them Legos, the little building blocks that I loved as a kid.  They haven&#8217;t changed much over the years, but I found myself falling in love with them all over again.</p>

<p>My daughter loves Star Wars something she certainly got from me and they had the Imperial Shuttle Craft and it was really cool.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YaXLO.jpg" alt="Shuttle"/></p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t buy it, but I plan to go back and get it.  I mean, how awesome does that thing look?  My kids are all over Legos now so I&#8217;ve got a great excuse to play with them too.</p></div>

        <h1>Post to Tumblr from terminal</h1><div><p>If you use Tumblr and you want to post articles from the command-line, there is a great Ruby gem that allows you to do this.  Its called Tumblr-rb and you can install it by issuing:</p>

<pre>gem install tumblr-rb</pre>

<p>It is very easy to use and it certainly solves the problem of posting articles via a shell script.</p>

        <h1>Drobo pro saves me from hard drive failure</h1><div><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Xz7tM.gif" alt="DroboPhoto"/></p>

<p>I bought a <a href="http://drobo.com">Drobo Pro</a> last year because I needed a reliable storage system.  I was running a startup out of my home and I wanted not only a redundant backup solution, but something that could expand and not cost me an arm and a leg.  Loosing data wasn&#8217;t an option.</p>

<p>Storage solutions are complicated and expensive, but Drobo is actually pretty easy.  It isn&#8217;t a RAID system, but operates a lot like one except it doesn&#8217;t require you to do any difficult configuration.  Simply pop in your drives, make a simple selection on how big of a disk you want, and you are done.</p>

<p>When I received my Drobo Pro, I configured it, copied my data to it and then completely forgot about it.  It worked flawlessly and was super fast.  (More on that later.)</p>

<p>Fast forward to now.  My Drobo prompts me that there is a disk failure and my data is now unprotected.  The Drobo Pro can survive a single disk failure, but two or more and you&#8217;ve lost your data.  I&#8217;ve got a hot spare sitting around, so I pop it in, Drobo does its thing and then goes back into a nominal status.  Everything is protected once again and there was no data loss.</p>

<p>There are an array of Drobo options, some cheaper than what I bought, and some more expensive.  For me, the big seller on the Drobo Pro is that it uses iSCSI to connect to your Mac.  In simple terms, this means I use a Cat 5 cable to connect my ethernet jack on my Mac to the ethernet jack on the back of the Drobo Pro.  Now this isn&#8217;t normal ethernet, it is iSCI which uses gigabit ethernet to get speeds up to 200mb/sec.  It is crazy fast, copying gigs of data or imaging my entire Macbook Pro in a fraction of the speed of even ESATA, there really isn&#8217;t anything like it.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
Actually, they did not pull the update.  Apple makes it really hard to tell if you are running preview 1 or 2.  I was running 1 and preview 3 only shows up for preview 2 users.  A quick upgrade and it worked.</p>

<p>The Google Chromebook is either going to be a massive success or abysmal failure.  There is no in between.  I think there is a market for a secure mobile platform, but the power and versatility of the iPad and its massive market of apps is going to hamper the adoption of the Chromebook.  Google&#8217;s Chrome app store is paltry in comparison.   Its all about the app stores these days.</p></div>

<blockquote><p><strong>Does holding your farts in hurt you over the long run?</strong></p>
<p>In this <a href="http://sciencenet.cn/upload/blog/file/2010/1/2010123203248875447.pdf">recent publication</a> by Ara Sahakian and his colleagues at the Gastroenterology division of the Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in LA, they reviewed a variety of publications related to flatulence and determined that in fact the gases produced by our gut might damage the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Even though methane (CH4) only makes up 7.2% of the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5486278">400-1,200mL</a> of gases we emit per day, their literature review suggested it was likely to cause the most harm, along with hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Both these gases are present in greater amounts in patients’ breath tests (yup - gas escapes through your mouth too!) who have gastrointestinal diseases, including <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/x37k44672g6188v8/">colon cancer</a>.</p>
<p>The authors were cautious to state that, “Evidence is now accumulating to suggest that methanogenic organisms and their gaseous by-products may actively participate in control of intestinal motor function,” though they emphasized, “Clearly, further investigation in this area is required.”</p>
<p>Certainly something to consider next time you’re going to reinforce the negative cultural reactions often exhibited towards flatulence. I’m sure we can all agree though: <strong>Never on the Elevator</strong>.</p>

        <h1>Mounting &amp; unlocking two drives at startup with PGP WDE</h1><div><p>I&#8217;ve got a Macbook Pro which I use for everything.  I live in apps that use a lot of resources like Photoshop, Xcode and Powerpoint.  Speed is important to me and the biggest limiting factor is my HD.  So I pulled out the absolutely useless Macbook Pro DVD drive and replaced with it a HD.  My boot drive is an SSD drive which means fast boot times and fast application load times.  My home folder resides on the 2nd hard drive which has more space and it better suited for lots of reads and writes than a SSD drive.</p>

<p>This configuration is great, but makes security difficult.  I want encrypted drives so that I rest assured that if I ever loose my notebook, the source code and other valuable documents that I carry around is safe.  I am a PGPWDE (PGP Whole Disk Encryption) user and I&#8217;ve used WDE fairly successfully with a single drive setup, but read really bad things about using it for a dual drive setup.  You see the problem is that your home folder resides on a 2nd disk that doesn’t get mounted until you enter your password after logging in.  This can cause all sorts of problems with the worst of it being corruption.</p>

<p>Playing around with the PGP command line, I was able to find a way to not only encrypt both drives using WDE, but have them both mount after logging into the bootloader and before the OS even loads.</p>

<p>This setup is actually pretty simple.  It takes advantage of a feature called Drive Groups for which there is no documentation anywhere.  Here are the steps:</p>

<ul><li>Encrypt your boot drive normally.  Lets call this Disk 0.  When it is encrypted, you should have a boot loader screen asking you for your PGP password at bootup.  Now you are ready to go to the next step.</li>
</ul><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uxiQT.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/uxiQT.png"/></p>

<ul><li><p>You need to encrypt the 2nd drive (the one with your home folder) but you&#8217;ll want to do it via the command line using the add group option:</p>

<pre> pgpwde —add-group-disk —base-disk (put your boot disk #) —disk (put the 2nd disk #) —auto   —passphrase ‘password’ —user ‘your name’</pre></li>
</ul><p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RJMUh.png" alt="http://i.imgur.com/RJMUh.png"/></p>

<p>That should cause your 2nd disk to start encrypting.  It is also instrumented to the bootloader so when you login, it is automatically decrypted and mounted.</p>

<p>These instructions seems to work fine for Mac OS X Snow Leopard.  I haven’t tried it on any other OS, but because this is all happening before the OS loads, I assume it should work for Windows and Linux.</p></div>

CPR should be a mandatory class for all students middle school and up with refresher courses every year.</p>

<p>This video is crazy.  A snowmobiler on a mountain crashes and tumbles down with this snowmobile.  He survives, but you have to watch how dumb this guy is trying to save his snowmobile which almost rolls over him several times.

I killed my notebook last night install SecureDoc.  It is a piece of software that is supposed to encrypt my hard drives.  This isn&#8217;t a big deal actually because I backup religiously, but it means re-install.  So why not try OS X Lion?  The product installs fine, seems to be compatible with all of my apps and runs really fast.  I mean super snappy.  And this copy is a preview copy so you&#8217;d think it would be slow and unoptimized.  Sure there are minor bugs here and there, but this OS is getting close to release.</p></div>

        <h1>Vico - Mac text editor</h1><div><p>There is a new Mac text editor in the mix and its name is Vico.  <a href="http://www.vicoapp.com">Vico</a> is the result of a personal itch from the author who wanted a beautiful modern Mac editor with the power and feature set of Textmate and VI.
</p>

<p>Vico is clearly inspired by a lot of great software and in a lot of ways captures some of those innovations and then improves upon them.  For example, Vico supports Bundles from Textmate.  But rather than manually downloading them, it provides a built in plugin manager.  It is so much better than how Textmate does it.</p>

<p>Another nice feature in Vico is the built in Explorer window.  You can easily activate it via a button on the toolbar on top and make it go away when you don’t need it.
</p>

<p>Lastly, Vico has built in SFTP support.  This is actually an awesome feature because it lets me work on blog files without needing to use a separate program.
</p>

<p>Vico is in development so you&#8217;ll need to update it with a new version every week or so.  (It expires after a few days.)  It should be released soon as it is very far along in its development.  It works great for me.</p></div>
