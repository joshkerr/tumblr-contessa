        <h1>Cortex is an amazing Tumblr extension for Chrome</h1><div><p>￼<img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1304214250.jpg" alt="myTumblr Image"/></p>

<p>I am a big fan of Chrome and I like to blog on Tumblr.  Then along came Cortex (<a href="http://www.cortexapp.com">http://www.cortexapp.com</a>) which changed the way I blog.  Previously I used to write a blog article once or twice a week.  These infrequent articles were lengthy and took me a while to write.  Back in those days I was using Wordpress which seemed more like a writer’s blog platform.  Then I switched to Tumblr which allowed me to easily re-blog other Tumblr articles.  Now I could easily blog a few articles a day, but my selection was rather limited for doing re-blogs because it only worked on other Tumblogs.<br/></p>

<p>Now enter Cortex.  It is a simple Chrome Extension which lets you quickly blog content that you see on the page.  Simply position the cursor over the item you want to share.  Press and hold the mouse button for a few seconds and a wheel appears letting you blog it to Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter or Instapaper.  It does a great job formatting the images and even allows you to add text if you want it.</p>

<p>I’ve used it without a problem to blog video too.  Just browse to a youtube video and use Cortex to create a Tumblr video post.</p>

<p>This app allows me to blog 5 − 10 times a day.  My Tumblog looks more like a Twitter stream which I much prefer to the lengthy articles of yesterday.</p></div>

<p>When I was visual communications student back in the day, I bought a 70’s-era Canon rangefinder on eBay for $50 because I’d read that they were similar to the classic Leica M’s, which I’d never be able to afford. I loved it and I learned to be a better photographer because of the constraints.</p>
<p>Ultimately, dealing with film became a non-starter as everything went digital so I gave it to a buddy but I’ve long pined for a nice digital rangefinder. Epson made and discontinued one a few years ago that took Leica lenses, Leica of course built digital M’s still priced out of my reach and there are a few other fixed focal length kits out there but nothing has really turned my head.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/technology/personaltech/21pogue.html?nl=technology&amp;pagewanted=all">Fuji X100</a>, though. Hoo, boy, now that looks like something, doesn’t it? Beautiful build, manual knobs, a fast f/2 35-mm equivalent lens, an optional TTL viewfinder mode, HD video and a few other tricks.</p>
<p>It sounds like it has a few quirks but this is the first digital rangefinder that I’ve gotten excited about.</p>

<p>Ahead of today’s 5pm <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/earningsq211/">conference call,</a> Apple <a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=107357&amp;p=irol-news">released its earnings report</a> for the <a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/rtn/pr/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/rfid436532209/?channel=pf">second quarter of fiscal 2011</a> (otherwise known as the first calendar quarter). Profit number: $5.99B in the quarter. Total revenue for the quarter is US$24.6 billion, versus 13.5B year-over-year. Earnings per diluted share comes in at $6.40, versus $3.33 last year. Forecasting $23B revenue for the next quarter.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Product sales numbers rolled in as follows: 28% up year over year in Macs with 3.76M sold in the quarter, 18.6M iPhones (113% unit growth), 9.02M iPods (including the iPod touch) and 4.69M iPads, including the iPad 2. (The number on iPad sales <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/18/apple-suing-samsung-galaxy-too-similar-to-iphone-look-and-feel/">disclosed via the Samsung lawsuit</a> was thought to be <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/04/20/about-those-19-million-ipads/">only counting the original iPad</a>, but it may have included the iPad 2 which was supply-constrained.) We were expecting a big Mac number based on the <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/18/npd-mac-sales-up-47-in-march">predictions from Gene Munster and sales data from NPD</a>.</p>
<p>You can <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/18/analysts-release-their-q2-2011-earnings-estimates?icid=sphere_blogsmith_inpage_engadget">compare and contrast</a> the actual numbers against the predictions made by Wall Street analysts and top stock bloggers via the <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/04/18/apple-q2-2011-earnings-preview/">compilation done over at Apple 2.0/Fortune Tech</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll be <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/earningsq211/">listening in</a> to the conference call and <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/20/apple-q2-2011-results-call-liveblog/">liveblogging all the fun</a> — join in!</p>

<p>Really cool stuff from adobe.  Navigate Adobe Photoshop projects with your iPad.  I wonder how long it will take before the Blackberry Tablet can do this.  Never?  Read more from TUAW:</p>

<blockquote>

    John Nack, Principal Product Manager at Adobe, <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2011/04/demo-adobe-nav-for-ipad-for-photoshop-cs5.html">posted a video demo of Adobe Nav for iPad on his blog</a> Saturday morning. Adobe Nav is one of the first apps to showcase the new tablet integration features included with the software maker&#8217;s upcoming Creative Suite version 5.5 (CS5.5). The video demonstrates two of the iPad app&#8217;s most useful features: the ability to build a custom tool palette and navigation among open Photoshop projects.

        <h1>Mars Edit for power users - (Markdown)</h1><div><p>You are a Mars Edit user and you want to start writing your posts in Markdown but you aren&#8217;t sure where to start.  You want the preview feature to show the actual theme on your blow.  You need quick access to macros but aren&#8217;t sure how to set them.</p>
<p>If you fit into any of these categories, this post will help you.  I&#8217;ve managed to configure a good workflow around MarsEdit that makes the tedium of writing blog entries rather easy.  Or easier, you still have to write the content.</p>
<p><strong>Using Markdown</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you need to do to write in Markdown is to tell MarsEdit to default to the HTML edit view.</p>
<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Preferences.png" alt="Preferences" title="Preferences.png" border="0" width="500"/></p>
<p>Just check the option for &#8220;HTML Text.&#8221;  This will make MarsEdit default to the HTML mode which means your Markdown syntax doesn&#8217;t get ruined in the visual editor.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Next go into the settings for your blog and change the Default Preview Filter to Markdown.</p>

<p><strong>Customize the Macros</strong></p>
<p>I created custom macros to create links, references, blockquote, etc..   You can get to the customize menu from the &#8220;Format&#8221; toolbar.  Just choose &#8220;edit&#8221; and create a bunch of macros.  This really speeds up adding images, links, etc..</p>
<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MarsEdit.png" alt="MarsEdit" title="Custom Macro Editor" border="0" width="359" height="205"/></p>
<p>The image above shows some of the custom macros and the editor used to create them.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>If you follow these tips, you&#8217;ll have a faster workflow for creating new content for your blog.  Feel free to suggest new tips in the comments below.</p></div>

        <h1>Being productive on an airplane - GTD</h1><div><p>How do you get things done at 35,000 feet on an airplane with no power and no Internet access?  Its actually not that hard as long as you spend a little bit of time preparing before the flight.  My pre-flight preparation takes about 10 minutes and allows me to get a lot of work done.</p>
<p>### Power</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have a power adapter on your flight so you are going to need to get the most out of your notebook&#8217;s battery.  I recommend charging your computer before the flight.  It helps if you bring along an extra battery like the one from [Hyper Mac][], but you can get surprising battery run times by lowering your display brightness, disabling any wireless signals like Bluetooth &amp; Wifi and keeping CPU intensive &amp; disk intensive tasks at bay.</p>
<p>I also recommend taking a look at [Watts][], it is a Mac program that helps you keep your battery properly exercised so that it gives you the longest and best performance possible.  </p>
<p>### No Internet</p>
<p>Some flights have Wifi Internet access, but you don&#8217;t need it to get a lot done.  If you have an offline reader or use an app like [Instapaper][] or [ReadItLater][], you can pre-download content to read while you are offline.  I integrate Instapaper with Google Reader and spend some time tagging articles that I&#8217;m interested in reading while in flight.</p>
<p>I also like [Reeder][] which can sync my Google Reader account to my notebook so that I can read the articles while in flight.</p>
<p>### Comfort</p>
<p>Having enough space to be comfortable is tough to achieve and not necessarily possible on all flights, but there are some things you can do:</p>
<p>* Search for empty flights.  You typically can get an empty seat next to you<br/>
* Opt for the extra leg room seats<br/>
* Look for emergency exit seats</p>
<p>### Conclusion</p>
<p>With a little bit of preparation you can get a lot done on your flight.</p>

        <h1>Wordpress + Markdown quicktags = bliss</h1><div><p>If you are authoring posts in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> and you are a Wordpress user, you NEED this plugin.  It is called <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/code/markdown-quicktags/">Markdown QuickTags</a> and creates a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> specific editor for writing your Wordpress posts from within the standard editor.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.wpengine.com/screenshots//Add_New_Post_%E2%80%B9_Josh_Kerr_%E2%80%94_WordPress-20110406-154739.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the editor"/></p>

<p>The editor has a lot of shortcuts that make writing in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> a breeze.</p>

<ul><li>Toolbar with quick links for creating links</li>
<li>Ordered and unordered lists</li>
<li>Blockquotes</li>
<li>Horizontal rules</li>
<li>And Wordpress more code</li>
</ul><p>It also has the capability to format existing HTML code and transforming it into <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, it has a full screen editor and preview mode making it really easy to write from your web browser.</p>

<p>The editor is supposedly very BETA with the author only having tested on Wordpress 3.0+ and only on a mac.  I&#8217;m using both, so it might break if you aren&#8217;t on that specific platform.</p></div>

        <h1>nvALT launches 2.0 with HTML preview support</h1><div><p><a href="http://elasticthreads.tumblr.com/">nvALT</a> is a fork of <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> a powerful note taking system.  What I like about <a href="http://elasticthreads.tumblr.com/">nvALT</a> over <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> is that it seems to be geared more for bloggers.  The 2.0 version takes that even further by giving you a customizable HTML/CSS preview window.  You can add your blog&#8217;s theme and now get an accurate preview when calling up your preview window.</p>

<p>I write my blog entries in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> because they are easier to write and read than HTML.  Sure I can use a visual editor, but I like the power and control of writing source, a by product of my years as a coder.</p>

<p><a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a> has other powerful features as well.  </p></div>

        <h1>Jetbrains releases Objective C IDE early preview</h1><div><p>I&#8217;m not sure what <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">Jetbrains</a> is thinking releasing a competitor IDE to Xcode.  Sure, they do have some great features baked into their other editors and it would be nice to have some of them in XCode, but there is no chance that anything they produce will come close to the power of Xcode.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/appCode-EAP-Objective-C-IDE-Confluence.jpg" alt="AppCode EAP  Objective C IDE  Confluence" title="appCode EAP - Objective-C IDE - Confluence.jpg" border="0" width="550" height="414"/></p>

<p>They are calling it <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/index.html">appCode</a> and it has the following features:</p>

<ul><li>An IDE with really smart code editing</li>
<li>Runes on OSX Intel boxes only</li>
<li>Integrates with interface builder</li>
<li>can run iOS simulator</li>
<li>Has a debugger with evaluate expression</li>
<li>Already has &#8216;change signature&#8217; and &#8216;extract method&#8217;</li>
<li>Supports subversion, git, perforce and cvs</li>
<li>Oh and really intelligent code completion</li>
</ul><p>Most of these sound like stuff that Xcode 3 did.  With Xcode 4 you can do a lot more than this.  Why would I want to run Interface Builder in a separate app when I can have it combined wth Xcode 4?</p>

<p>I would not bet on this losing horse.</p></div>

<p>I took this photo with Instagram.  I&#8217;m really digging this app.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m also digging the new photo sharing feature in Flickr.  It places a one click button at the top of your Flickr photos making sharing easy as pie.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2546660940" href="http://joshkerr.com/2011/04/nyc-subway-at-42nd-st/nyc-subway-at-42nd-st-flickr-photo-sharing-1/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2546660940" title="NYC subway at 42nd St | Flickr - Photo Sharing!-1" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/NYC-subway-at-42nd-St-Flickr-Photo-Sharing-1.jpg" alt="" width="426" height="374"/></a></p>

<p>The icons are a bit lame, especially for a photo sharing service as popular as Flickr, but hey, its a Yahoo company.</p>

<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-2546660942" href="http://joshkerr.com/2011/04/nyc-subway-at-42nd-st/nyc-subway-at-42nd-st-flickr-photo-sharing/"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2546660942" title="NYC subway at 42nd St | Flickr - Photo Sharing!" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/NYC-subway-at-42nd-St-Flickr-Photo-Sharing.jpg" alt="" width="422" height="232"/></a></p>

<p>I guess I should be happy that Flickr is still around.  It was only two months ago that I downloaded all of my photos from the service thinking that Yahoo was about to fold.  Now I&#8217;m using &lt;a href=&#8221;http://backupify.com&#8221;&gt;Backupify&lt;/a&gt; to back things up so I guess I&#8217;m safe.  Wow, talk about a rant of a post.</p></div>

        <h1>How to get Spotify in the US on your iPhone</h1><div><p>If you are like me, you&#8217;ve been drooling over the <a href="http://spotify.com/">Spotify</a> service which is only available in Europe.  It lets you listen to a massive selection of music without having to buy it.  It has social sharing built in, and it works great on your iPhone.  If only it was available in the US.</p>

<p>If you try to register or download the software from a computer within the US you are greeted with this lovely message:</p>

<p><img title="Spotify – Premium, Unlimited, Open - Music Site - Online Music.jpg" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Spotify-%E2%80%93-Premium-Unlimited-Open-Music-Site-Online-Music.jpg" border="0" alt="Spotify  Premium Unlimited Open  Music Site  Online Music" width="484" height="170"/></p>

<p>What if you live in Europe and you happen to be visiting the US?  What if you need access to the software from outside the UK?  Well, it turns out that you can.  Even from within the US.  So how does a US person access the service?  Well, by pretending you live in Europe.</p>

<p>I was able to activate the service both on my computer and my iPhone.  I listen to it all the time and it works perfectly.</p>

<p>I believe that the only reason Spotify doesn&#8217;t work in the US is that they haven&#8217;t secured the licensing required to operate here.  I imagine that sometime this year they will secure the rights and launch the service.  Rumors suggest this will happen sooner than later.</p>

<h2>How to get Spotify in the US</h2>

<p>First you need to create a Spotify account.  To do this you will need to fool Spotify in thinking that you are coming from a UK server.  I used a Proxy server to do this.  There are a ton on the Internet, just do a Google search for &#8220;UK Proxy server&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find one.</p>

<p>I used this one: <a href="http://www.daveproxy.co.uk/"><a href="http://www.daveproxy.co.uk/">http://www.daveproxy.co.uk/</a></a></p>

<p>Browse to the Spotify site and create a new account.  Make sure to choose the free service (they won&#8217;t let you buy a subscription.  More on that later.)  Once you have your account, it is time to download the software.</p>

<p>Using the same proxy, download and install the desktop software.  For the iPhone software we are going to need a new iTunes account.  No problem.</p>

<p>Launch iTunes and select the iTunes Store.  At the bottom you should see a link to change country.</p>

<p><img title="iTunes.jpg" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/iTunes.jpg" border="0" alt="ITunes" width="550" height="177"/></p>

<p>Click it and register a new account.  I used a UK address I found in google.  It doesn&#8217;t matter which one you use, you aren&#8217;t going to add a credit card or use this account for anything other than downloading the client.  Make sure to use a real email account that isn&#8217;t already associated with another iTunes account.  You will need to activate the account via email.</p>

<p>Do not add a credit card to your iTunes Account.  When you are done created it, activate your account via email.  Now you should be able to download the Spotify client.</p>

<p>Sync it to your iPhone.  Now comes the last step.  You need to upgrade to a Premium subscription in order to use the iPhone client.  You are going to need to hop on to Ebay and purchase a subscription.</p>

<p>I purchased mine from eleanor_1257.  This person responded really quickly and within a few minutes I had my premium account.  You&#8217;ll need to give away your login so that they can login and activate your account via their UK credit card.  Since I didn&#8217;t have any personal information in my spotify account, I had no problem doing that.</p>

<p>I highly recommend the Spotify service.  It is a great way to enjoy a massive amount of music without needing to shell out an arm and a leg.  Consider me satisfied.</p></div>

        <h1>Wrapped up taping for a TV show pilot</h1><div><p>I&#8217;ve never been featured in a TV show before so when I received a call from a producer wanting to create a series based on entrepreneurs with me as the first, I was shocked.  Once the initial shock subsided, I felt fear.</p>

<p>Its not that I&#8217;m afraid of being in the spotlight, far from it actually, I&#8217;ve been on the stage in front of hundreds of people either making a speech, or demoing a product.  What scared me is that this great opportunity was placed in my lap and I&#8217;m certainly not the most successful entrepreneur in Austin.  There are countless CEO&#8217;s who&#8217;ve achieved more, done more and should receive this honor in place of me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of the Austin startup community and a TV show featuring Austin entrepreneurs is a great way to further the growth of this community.  I&#8217;m honored to be the one chosen to kick off the series.</p>

<p>After a month of planning, the filming happened this past Friday.  I started at the Harris Hill Race track to shoot footage of me driving around the track (something I love to do in my off time) and then shifted to my home where they I participated in an in-depth interview.  It was a lot of fun, but I suspect even more exciting when I can actually watch it on TV.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have any details on when it will air, but I&#8217;ll certainly publish more as I find out.</p></div>

        <h1>Firebug vs Chrome Web Dev</h1><div><p>I love Google Chrome, and I love that it has web development tools built into it.  If you right click on a web page you get the option to &#8220;inspect element.&#8221;  This pulls up a great tool that will open the curtain to the structure of the currently displayed website.  Firefox also has a great tool called Firebug, but it doesn&#8217;t ship with the browser, instead you will need to download a plugin.</p>

<p>With the soon be released Firefox 4, I&#8217;ve been using Firebug and I think I might like it better than the Google Chrome counterpart.</p></div>
