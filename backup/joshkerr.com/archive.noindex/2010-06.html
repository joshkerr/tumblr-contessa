<p>Chrome: Blank Canvas is a user script manager for Google Chrome that makes Greasemonkey scripts more compatible with Chrome while also providing a nice interface for managing those user scripts.               <a title="Click here to read more about Blank Canvas Is a Greasemonkey Script Manager for Chrome [Downloads]" href="http://lifehacker.com/5557629/blank-canvas-is-a-greasemonkey-script-manager-for-chrome">More&#160;»</a> <br style="clear: both;"/><br style="clear: both;"/></p>

<p>Standout Numbers:</p>

<li>Wireless: 802.11N finally - though iOS 4 might enable it on the 3GS</li>

<li>Facetime is now an open standard which means Apple and partners will be building for other platforms like gulp* Android.</li>
<li>More Battery life, up to an hour of talk time more - that is a big one over Android who already lags in battery.</li>

And paid devs are almost ready to finally start shipping apps leveraging the new firmware’s amazingly cool features. We can’t wait until we start seeing VoiP and Game Center apps in action.<br/><br/> Today, you’ll be able to head on over to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apple’s developer site</span></a> and start downloading your copy of the 4.0 SDK release candidate. Although the site still shows beta 4, the gold master release candidate, as Steve announced at the Keynote this morning, should be ready momentarily.<br/><br/> Of course, the <a href="http://tuaw.com/tag/ipad">iPad</a> SDK is another matter. Any iPad SDK, when it appears (likely in the fall sometime), will remain under an ongoing NDA until that firmware and SDK is officially released. But the good news is that the new version of the iPhone firmware is <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/06/07/wwdc-2010-second-generation-ipod-touch-gets-free-update-to-ios4/">just around the corner on June 21st</a>.</p>
