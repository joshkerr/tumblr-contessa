<p>I love Sushi.  I eat it all the time.  Last week on of of my colleagues at work took me to one of the best Sushi restaurants in the US.  <a href="http://www.sushiran.com">Sushi Ran</a>.</p>

<p>We sat at the Sushi bar and ate Omakase where the chef chooses our dishes.  There were three of us and sushi was served three at a time so that we could each sample a piece before the next round.  The fish was fantastic, the service was great and overall it was one my favorite Sushi meals.  I will be going back if I can get a reservation.</p>

<p>Speaking of reservations, make sure to make one well in advance.  The restaurant is small and it is very popular.</p>

        <h1>Twitter, did you just change your icon again?</h1><div><p><img class="dropshadow" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Twitter.png" border="0" alt="Twitter.png" width="63" height="70"/><img class="dropshadow" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Twitter2.png" border="0" alt="Twitter2.png" width="70" height="72"/></p>

<p>Why would you change your icon again?  The Mac App Store launches, Twitter launches a new client with a black Icon.  It looked cool.  Then they released an update with a blue icon.  Now a third update with a 3d icon.  Why?  Just focus on making your app less annoying.</p>

<p><img class="dropshadow" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/MarsEdit.png" border="0" alt="MarsEdit.png" width="461" height="74"/></p>

<p>A normal Mac App has the minimize, maximize and close icons at the top right in standard red, yellow and green.</p>

<p><img class="dropshadow" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Twitter12.png" border="0" alt="Twitter1.png" width="433" height="99"/></p>

<p>Twitter decided to write their own UI with black icons.  While it might look good, it isn&#8217;t that easy to use.  Why not keep the standard OS UI?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m done with my rant now.</p></div>

<p><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> is like crack cocaine but for blogging.  It sucks you in, addicts you and then leaves you craving more.  The problem is that like drugs, it isn&#8217;t always around.  I&#8217;ve had more outages on Tumblr than any other hosted service with many outages lasting days.  I&#8217;m quitting my drug habit, see you later Tumblr.</p>

<p>Tumblr is great for setting up a quick nicely styled blog and it has a good selection of tools to create content.  I love how each post is split into a category, links, text, photos, etc..  All of that is good, but can be replicated on other blogging platforms.  For example, Wordpress.</p>

<p>Tumblr does not allow you to leave their service easily.  While they suck blog content into their service from their old blogs, they make it difficult to switch back.  I had to use a python script to scrape my content away and spent some considerable time editing it to make it work on Wordpress.</p>

<p>I wish I could take my Tumblr <a href="http://scaffold.tumblr.com/">theme</a> with me.  I contacted the artist who made it and he informed me that the rights to it are owned by Tumblr.  That theme is the only thing I&#8217;m going to miss.</p></div>

<p>No Tweetie beta was released and all of the MacHeist users were essentially left out in the cold.  Until today.  Tweetie 2 was released to the Mac AppStore and with it comes a surprise.  If you click on the help menu item while holding down option+control+command you&#8217;ll be prompted with a screen that lets you enter your email and MacHeist serial number.  Do this and you get this screen:</p>
