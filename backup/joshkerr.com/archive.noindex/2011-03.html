        <h1>Ingredients an Xcode documentation viewer</h1><div><p>I don&#8217;t know why it took two guys who don&#8217;t work at Apple to make a half decent documentation viewer for Xcode developer documents.  The one built into Xcode 4 is slow and presents data in a not very friendly manner.</p>

<p>If you take a look at Apple&#8217;s organizer you&#8217;ll see that there is a lot of wasted space.  Why isn&#8217;t the left pane of the split view populated?  How is that breadcrumb organizer on top helpful?  Why can&#8217;t I use a more advanced search?</p>

<p>Now take a look at <a href="http://fileability.net/ingredients/">Ingredients</a> an open source app that lets you view the same documents, but with in a much more useful way.</p>

<p>Not only do I get split view panes with data, but the data makes sense.  This is my new goto document viewer for Xcode developer documents.</p></div>

        <h1>Slow computer?  Add two hard drives.</h1><div><p>I have a Macbook Pro which has 8gigs of RAM, a super fast processor, and runs dog slow.  Knowing that the bottle neck is usually the HD, I went out and bought an SSD drive to replace the existing HD.  This worked for a little bit until the SSD became too fragmented from lack of TRIM support.  Now my notebook is slower than it was with a regular HD.</p>

<p>I did some research and learned that SSD drives are great for boot devices, but not so good as scratch devices.  Ahhh.   So now I know what to do.  I quickly ordered an OWC <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/DDAMBS0GB/">data doubler</a> which would let me mount a second HD where my optical drive is.  (I never use my optical drive.)   I used <a href="http://diglloydtools.com/disktester.html">disk tester</a> to recondition my SSD drive.  Lastly I reconfigured my OS to put the /Users folder on my 2nd HD.</p>

<p>Now I&#8217;ve got a small but fast <a href="http://www.intel.com/design/flash/nand/productinformation.htm">intel</a> SSD drive as a boot device.  I have a 750gig 7200rpm drive as my scratch device (it holds my /Users folder.)  The computer screams.  Its never been this fast.  If I get any requests, I&#8217;ll post the instructions so that you can do this yourself.</p></div>

        <h1>Repairing your disk with PGP whole disk encryption Mac</h1><div><p>You’ve got your boot drive encrypted using PGP’s <a href="http://www.symantec.com/business/whole-disk-encryption">whole disk encryption</a>.  Great, you are security conscious feeling all safe and secure, but how do you fix file system errors and disk issues?</p>
<p>In the past, you would boot off of your Mac OS install DVD and run Disk Utility.  If you do that now, you’ll kill your disk and won’t be able to boot anymore.  The problem is that the disk needs to be decrypted in order for you to repair the filesystem, but how can you do that with the install DVD?  Short answer, you can’t.  Long answer, there is a way to repair your disk, but it will involve using a second drive in order to do it.  This post will walk you through how you can safely and quickly repair your encrypted boot drive.</p>
<p>You will need the following:</p>
<ul><li>Disk Utility (comes with your mac)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html">SuperDuper!</a></li>
<li>Extra USB or Firewire HD (I recommend a thumb drive)</li>
<li>15 gigs of free space</li>
</ul><p>First, you will need to install Mac OSX to the extra drive.  Do a minimal install to save space (if you are short on a space.)  You really only need the core OS.</p>
<p>Second, boot off the extra drive into your newly installed OS and install all of the Apple updates by running “Software Update” from the Apple menu.</p>
<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/SuperDuper%21.png" alt="SuperDuper in action" width="500"/></p>
<p>Third, install PGP.</p>
<p>Now you’ve got a bootable version of Mac OS X with PGP installed.  If you ever want to check your drive for errors, just boot off the newly created disk, use PGP to unlock your drive, and then run Disk Utility to fix it.  I used a USB drive so I could carry it around with me in case I needed a quick fix on the road.</p></div>

        <h1>rsa security conference loves the cloud</h1><div><p>As part of my day job, i got to attend the <a href="http://www.rsaconference.com/">RSA security conference</a> going on now in San Francisco.  I spent some time walking through the different booths and came away with a feeling that there isn&#8217;t much innovation happening in the industry.  There is a strong push toward the cloud and cloud based security, but from a security technology perspective, you&#8217;ve got the same techniques applied to updated hardware and software.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m no security expert, actually far from it, so my first job was to find out what RSA stands for.  I asked four different attendees and not a single one knew.  I ended up Googling it and learned that it stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, the inventors of the algorithm for public key encryption.  Like those that I quizzed, it is doubtful that I will commit those names to memory.</p>

<p>I spoke to many different people representing all types of big enterprise, from government defense to banking to IT consulting.  Most were looking for new ways to improve their security, trying to lower the costs of fraud and information leakage.  I didn&#8217;t see anything at the conference that indicates that consumers or businesses will be any safer in the coming years.  In fact, I&#8217;d go so far to say that as we become more dependent on wireless devices for transactions such as payment, we&#8217;ll become even more vulnerable.</p>

<p>Depressing.</p></div>
