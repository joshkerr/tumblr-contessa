&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before  Stonehenge was built, well before the  Dead Sea Scrolls  were written, ancient artists painted life-sized figures on canyon walls in  Utah,  USA — but why?  Nobody is sure.  The entire panel of figures,  which dates back about 7,000 years, is called the  Great Gallery and was found on the walls of  Horseshoe  Canyon in  Canyonlands National  Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The humans who painted them likely hunted Mammoths.  The unusual fuzziness of largest figure led to  this mural section’s informal designation as the  &lt;a href="http://talkingtree.org/index.php?showimage=625"&gt;Holy Ghost Panel&lt;/a&gt;, although the intended attribution and societal importance of the figure are really unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above image was taken during a clear night in March.  The oldest objects in the above image are not the  pictographs, however, but the stars of our  Milky Way Galaxy far in the background, some of which are billions of years old.&lt;/p&gt;
