I like that I can publish with static files and that what I edit on my local machine is identical to what you see on my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating new posts can be a chore however because there are default tags that have to be added to each post.  You can automate this in a bunch of different ways, but I like this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just add this to your bash_profile to enable simple terminal commands for creating blog entries.  It will use Textmate as the editor, but you can easily swap it out for another.  Make sure to configure the directories correct as the ones above were configured for someone else.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
