The tiny appliance can be charged up, slipped into a bag and carried around for on-the-go scanning of documents, receipts or other slip of paper you want to digitize and save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/12/22/doxie-go-mobile-scanner-cuts-the-wires-sort-of/"&gt;we reviewed the Doxie Go in December&lt;/a&gt;, a workaround with &lt;a href="http://eye.fi/"&gt;Eye-Fi Wi-Fi / SD cards&lt;/a&gt; enabled wireless scanning of sorts, but now the devices have wireless functionality built in. Documents scanned with the new model can be sent to your computer, mobile device, or to Evernote, Flickr, or an FTP account. Its street price is listed at US$239.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check back with us all week as our team at Macworld | iWorld is providing complete coverage of all the goodies on the expo floor.&lt;/p&gt;
