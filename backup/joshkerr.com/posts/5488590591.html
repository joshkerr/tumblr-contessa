&lt;p&gt;I bought a &lt;a href="http://drobo.com"&gt;Drobo Pro&lt;/a&gt; last year because I needed a reliable storage system.  I was running a startup out of my home and I wanted not only a redundant backup solution, but something that could expand and not cost me an arm and a leg.  Loosing data wasn&amp;#8217;t an option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Storage solutions are complicated and expensive, but Drobo is actually pretty easy.  It isn&amp;#8217;t a RAID system, but operates a lot like one except it doesn&amp;#8217;t require you to do any difficult configuration.  Simply pop in your drives, make a simple selection on how big of a disk you want, and you are done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I received my Drobo Pro, I configured it, copied my data to it and then completely forgot about it.  It worked flawlessly and was super fast.  (More on that later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now.  My Drobo prompts me that there is a disk failure and my data is now unprotected.  The Drobo Pro can survive a single disk failure, but two or more and you&amp;#8217;ve lost your data.  I&amp;#8217;ve got a hot spare sitting around, so I pop it in, Drobo does its thing and then goes back into a nominal status.  Everything is protected once again and there was no data loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are an array of Drobo options, some cheaper than what I bought, and some more expensive.  For me, the big seller on the Drobo Pro is that it uses iSCSI to connect to your Mac.  In simple terms, this means I use a Cat 5 cable to connect my ethernet jack on my Mac to the ethernet jack on the back of the Drobo Pro.  Now this isn&amp;#8217;t normal ethernet, it is iSCI which uses gigabit ethernet to get speeds up to 200mb/sec.  It is crazy fast, copying gigs of data or imaging my entire Macbook Pro in a fraction of the speed of even ESATA, there really isn&amp;#8217;t anything like it.&lt;/p&gt;
