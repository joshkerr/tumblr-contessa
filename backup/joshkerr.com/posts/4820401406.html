&lt;p&gt;I love Sushi.  I eat it all the time.  Last week on of of my colleagues at work took me to one of the best Sushi restaurants in the US.  &lt;a href="http://www.sushiran.com"&gt;Sushi Ran&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat at the Sushi bar and ate Omakase where the chef chooses our dishes.  There were three of us and sushi was served three at a time so that we could each sample a piece before the next round.  The fish was fantastic, the service was great and overall it was one my favorite Sushi meals.  I will be going back if I can get a reservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of reservations, make sure to make one well in advance.  The restaurant is small and it is very popular.&lt;/p&gt;
