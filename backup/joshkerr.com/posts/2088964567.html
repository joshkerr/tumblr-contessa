&lt;p&gt;Zosh lets you fill in and sign documents from your mobile phone.  I started the company with my co-founder and good friend Alexander Bibighaus a few years back as a side project.  In March of this year we released the product and it became an instant hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve always considered my target audience people that could benefit from not having to be tied down to a fax machine to fill in a form or document and sign it.  Christina fits that mold, but to see her benefit from Zosh without using her hands really made me feel proud of what we built. &lt;/p&gt;</video-caption><video-source>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBuFTH_CQm0</video-source><video-player>&lt;iframe width="400" height="300" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nBuFTH_CQm0?wmode=transparent&amp;autohide=1&amp;egm=0&amp;hd=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;showsearch=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</video-player><video-player max-width="500">&lt;iframe width="500" height="375" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nBuFTH_CQm0?wmode=transparent&amp;autohide=1&amp;egm=0&amp;hd=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;showsearch=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</video-player><video-player max-width="250">&lt;iframe width="248" height="186" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nBuFTH_CQm0?wmode=transparent&amp;autohide=1&amp;egm=0&amp;hd=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;rel=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;showsearch=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</video-player></post>
