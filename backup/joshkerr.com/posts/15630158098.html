&lt;p&gt;So check &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5874656/fitbits-new-wifi-scale-looks-awesomely-familiar"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; out, its a scale that automatically sends your weight to a database on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would I want this?  I currently have a digital scale and it memorizes the last weight in its own internal memory.  I’m really good a jumping off the scale before it can determine my exact weight so that it doesn’t commit any of my weights to memory.  I just don’t want a log of how much I weight, that is personal information between me and the scale and certainly not the rest of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t understand what problem this scale is solving.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>rant</tag></post>
