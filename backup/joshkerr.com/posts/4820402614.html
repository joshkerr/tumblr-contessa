I&amp;#8217;ve been taking regular flights between Austin and San Jose and the flight (Alaska airlines) has wifi.  No only do they have wifi, they have really fast wifi.  I have no idea what technology is required to make this marvel possible, but wow is it cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember reading about Gizmodo editor Lam&amp;#8217;s first flight on Virgin and having wifi.  He blogged about it as if it was the best thing since sliced bread.  I feel the same way every time I get the opportunity to use it.  How is it that at 35,000 feet I can access the Internet?  Really cool.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
