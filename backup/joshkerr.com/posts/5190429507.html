I killed my notebook last night install SecureDoc.  It is a piece of software that is supposed to encrypt my hard drives.  This isn&amp;#8217;t a big deal actually because I backup religiously, but it means re-install.  So why not try OS X Lion?  The product installs fine, seems to be compatible with all of my apps and runs really fast.  I mean super snappy.  And this copy is a preview copy so you&amp;#8217;d think it would be slow and unoptimized.  Sure there are minor bugs here and there, but this OS is getting close to release.&lt;/p&gt;</link-description><tag>cool</tag></post>
