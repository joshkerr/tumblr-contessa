&lt;p&gt;This whole Anthony Weiner scandal is very disappointing to me.  I&amp;#8217;ve been a big supporter of his since he launched his first political campaign.  To see his career in politics melt away and all that he has achieved eclipsed by this dirty scandal is just plain disappointing.  Sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t the first political sex scandal and certainly not the last.  I don’t excuse his behavior of tweeting dirty photos or having a cyber relationship with another woman while being in a marriage, but what I do find really strange is that he didn’t admit and apologize right off the bat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one consistent thing we learn from sex scandals is that if you admit wrong doing and apologize, the story fades and what you are left with is more intact than if you delay and admin no wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take Arnold Schwartzeneggar.   He fathered another child during his marriage, the press found out, he quickly admitted to it, and the story is mostly gone.  Arnold still has a career.  Anthony on the other hand denies being involved in the most bizarre press conference I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen.  He couldn’t act more guilty than he did.   He poured gas on the fire and the press followed the flames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you are going to cheat and you get caught, admit what you did was wrong and move on.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>politics</tag></post>
