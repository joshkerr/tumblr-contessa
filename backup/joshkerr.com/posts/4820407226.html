I think Apple is doing this on purpose to prevent users from deploying beta versions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could see many reasons for Apple doing this, but the big one is that they enable features in a beta that they wanted tested and then disable them in a release.  Tethering is a good one.  I also think they users of beta copies create more support incidents which can be costly for a company that has such a large customers base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Either way, I don&amp;#8217;t see why a user would complain about this.  The software is beta for a reason.  End of rant.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
