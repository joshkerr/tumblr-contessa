Once the initial shock subsided, I felt fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not that I&amp;#8217;m afraid of being in the spotlight, far from it actually, I&amp;#8217;ve been on the stage in front of hundreds of people either making a speech, or demoing a product.  What scared me is that this great opportunity was placed in my lap and I&amp;#8217;m certainly not the most successful entrepreneur in Austin.  There are countless CEO&amp;#8217;s who&amp;#8217;ve achieved more, done more and should receive this honor in place of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of the Austin startup community and a TV show featuring Austin entrepreneurs is a great way to further the growth of this community.  I&amp;#8217;m honored to be the one chosen to kick off the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a month of planning, the filming happened this past Friday.  I started at the Harris Hill Race track to shoot footage of me driving around the track (something I love to do in my off time) and then shifted to my home where they I participated in an in-depth interview.  It was a lot of fun, but I suspect even more exciting when I can actually watch it on TV.&lt;/p&gt;
