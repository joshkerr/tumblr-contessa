&lt;p&gt;Ahead of today’s 5pm &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/earningsq211/"&gt;conference call,&lt;/a&gt; Apple &lt;a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=107357&amp;amp;p=irol-news"&gt;released its earnings report&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/rtn/pr/apple-reports-second-quarter-results/rfid436532209/?channel=pf"&gt;second quarter of fiscal 2011&lt;/a&gt; (otherwise known as the first calendar quarter). Profit number: $5.99B in the quarter. Total revenue for the quarter is US$24.6 billion, versus 13.5B year-over-year. Earnings per diluted share comes in at $6.40, versus $3.33 last year. Forecasting $23B revenue for the next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product sales numbers rolled in as follows: 28% up year over year in Macs with 3.76M sold in the quarter, 18.6M iPhones (113% unit growth), 9.02M iPods (including the iPod touch) and 4.69M iPads, including the iPad 2. (The number on iPad sales &lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/18/apple-suing-samsung-galaxy-too-similar-to-iphone-look-and-feel/"&gt;disclosed via the Samsung lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; was thought to be &lt;a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/04/20/about-those-19-million-ipads/"&gt;only counting the original iPad&lt;/a&gt;, but it may have included the iPad 2 which was supply-constrained.) We were expecting a big Mac number based on the &lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/04/18/npd-mac-sales-up-47-in-march"&gt;predictions from Gene Munster and sales data from NPD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
