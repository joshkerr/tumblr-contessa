I do a pretty good job of keeping my LinkedIn profile up to date, but I can’t really email that out as a resume replacement when applying for a job.  If I needed my resume today, I’d grab some old copy lying around on my computer buried in some old folder and re-write it on the spot with what has changed since I last needed it.  My memory isn’t so good so chances are good that I will fudge the details.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently read an article on &lt;a href="http://pseudoweb.net/2010/10/25/developing-your-resume/"&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; about a guy who wrote his resume in Markdown and then published it to the Git source control system where he keeps it up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is overkill, but I like the idea and it certainly does make the chore of resume management a lot easier once you’ve spent the requisite 5 hours setting this up.   The author published a Git &lt;a href="https://github.com/icco/Resume"&gt;project&lt;/a&gt; that you can fork if you are a member of Git and then markup to be your own.  If you are a Ruby master, you can easily publish the resume directly to your web-server for all your potential managers/bosses to see.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
