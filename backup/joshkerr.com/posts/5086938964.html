&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of Chrome and I like to blog on Tumblr.  Then along came Cortex (&lt;a href="http://www.cortexapp.com"&gt;http://www.cortexapp.com&lt;/a&gt;) which changed the way I blog.  Previously I used to write a blog article once or twice a week.  These infrequent articles were lengthy and took me a while to write.  Back in those days I was using Wordpress which seemed more like a writer’s blog platform.  Then I switched to Tumblr which allowed me to easily re-blog other Tumblr articles.  Now I could easily blog a few articles a day, but my selection was rather limited for doing re-blogs because it only worked on other Tumblogs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now enter Cortex.  It is a simple Chrome Extension which lets you quickly blog content that you see on the page.  Simply position the cursor over the item you want to share.  Press and hold the mouse button for a few seconds and a wheel appears letting you blog it to Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter or Instapaper.  It does a great job formatting the images and even allows you to add text if you want it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve used it without a problem to blog video too.  Just browse to a youtube video and use Cortex to create a Tumblr video post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app allows me to blog 5 − 10 times a day.  My Tumblog looks more like a Twitter stream which I much prefer to the lengthy articles of yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>tips</tag><tag>cool</tag><tag>featured</tag></post>
