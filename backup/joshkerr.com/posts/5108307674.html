&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Split%20screens.png" alt="Vico"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vico is clearly inspired by a lot of great software and in a lot of ways captures some of those innovations and then improves upon them.  For example, Vico supports Bundles from Textmate.  But rather than manually downloading them, it provides a built in plugin manager.  It is so much better than how Textmate does it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Screen%20shot%202011-05-01%20at%202.08.12%20PM.png" alt="Screenshot"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another nice feature in Vico is the built in Explorer window.  You can easily activate it via a button on the toolbar on top and make it go away when you don’t need it.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Vico has built in SFTP support.  This is actually an awesome feature because it lets me work on blog files without needing to use a separate program.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vico is in development so you&amp;#8217;ll need to update it with a new version every week or so.  (It expires after a few days.)  It should be released soon as it is very far along in its development.  It works great for me.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>interesting</tag><tag>cool</tag></post>
