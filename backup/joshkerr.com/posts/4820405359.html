Been a while sir.</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;It has been too long since I&amp;#8217;ve launched Xcode and with the new 4.0 version, I feel like I&amp;#8217;m learning to program all over again.  I don&amp;#8217;t need to use 4.0, I could continue to use 3.x as Apple will still accept App Store submissions with the older version, but I want to stay current and the new debugger is too good to pass up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xcode 4 is a significant upgrade for developers, offering a new IDE with a single view, a mechanism to automatically fix syntax mistakes, and a logic analyzer (not the hardware kind) that will find issues with your code logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it has been a while since I&amp;#8217;ve written any iOS code, the new version of Xcode feels about as alien as the previous version.  Most of my coding work of late has been in the web or not at all.  I&amp;#8217;m not a full time developer by trade, but I do enjoying writing code when I get the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that Apple does well that they don&amp;#8217;t quite get enough praise for is their software.  iOS, the dev tools, Final Cut Pro, all of it is really pretty amazing.  Some of the best software available from a commercial source.  Okay, enough praise, back to work.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
