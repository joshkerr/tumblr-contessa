&lt;p&gt;All of this is untrue if you are building web apps in HTMl5.  But the general population doesn&amp;#8217;t know it.  So why not create a web app store.  This instills confidence in the user that the pages are actually apps and that they will behave like apps.  I think Google did a good job with its version of the app store. &lt;/p&gt;
