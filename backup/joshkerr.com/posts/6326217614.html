This is fine if you are upgrading your existing Mac, but what about install to a Mac without an operating system?  Or worse, what do you do when you need to boot off an external drive to repair your Mac&amp;#8217;s internal drive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No worries, you can get to the Lion DMG file and burn that to any external disk.  Just right click on the Mac OSX Lion installer in your Applications folder.  Choose &amp;#8220;Show package contents.&amp;#8221;  Now choose the contents/SharedSupport folder.  In there is a 3+ gig .dmg file which you can burn to your external drive.  It is bootable and has the full install as well as the repair utilities like Disk Utility.  Nice.&lt;/p&gt;</photo-caption><photo-url max-width="1280">http://www.tumblr.com/photo/1280/joshkerr/6326217614/1/tumblr_lmhi9m0MYc1qz9lkr</photo-url><photo-url max-width="500">http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmhi9m0MYc1qz9lkro1_500.png</photo-url><photo-url max-width="400">http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmhi9m0MYc1qz9lkro1_400.png</photo-url><photo-url max-width="250">http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmhi9m0MYc1qz9lkro1_250.png</photo-url><photo-url max-width="100">http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmhi9m0MYc1qz9lkro1_100.png</photo-url><photo-url max-width="75">http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lmhi9m0MYc1qz9lkro1_75sq.png</photo-url><tag>tips</tag></post>
