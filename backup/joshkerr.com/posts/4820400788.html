&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.tumblr.com/"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; is like crack cocaine but for blogging.  It sucks you in, addicts you and then leaves you craving more.  The problem is that like drugs, it isn&amp;#8217;t always around.  I&amp;#8217;ve had more outages on Tumblr than any other hosted service with many outages lasting days.  I&amp;#8217;m quitting my drug habit, see you later Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tumblr is great for setting up a quick nicely styled blog and it has a good selection of tools to create content.  I love how each post is split into a category, links, text, photos, etc..  All of that is good, but can be replicated on other blogging platforms.  For example, Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tumblr does not allow you to leave their service easily.  While they suck blog content into their service from their old blogs, they make it difficult to switch back.  I had to use a python script to scrape my content away and spent some considerable time editing it to make it work on Wordpress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could take my Tumblr &lt;a href="http://scaffold.tumblr.com/"&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt; with me.  I contacted the artist who made it and he informed me that the rights to it are owned by Tumblr.  That theme is the only thing I&amp;#8217;m going to miss.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
