Compaq was a great place to work and it was my first job out of college.  I should feel loyal to the company and write a raving review about their newly announced tablet and phones.  If they had launched this stuff a year ago, I&amp;#8217;d be pretty enthusiastic, but with the iPad 2 and iPhone 5 on the horizon, HP has a lot of catching up to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one feature though that I think is pretty innovative.  HP showed how you could browse a web page on the tablet, then bump the phone against the table and the web page link transfers to the phone and then loads.  I&amp;#8217;m not sure what the use case is for this, but it seeing devices communicate wirelessly based on proximity is exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I go out and buy a Palm product?  No.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
