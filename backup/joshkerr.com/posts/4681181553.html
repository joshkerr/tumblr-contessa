Its actually not that hard as long as you spend a little bit of time preparing before the flight.  My pre-flight preparation takes about 10 minutes and allows me to get a lot of work done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### Power&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t have a power adapter on your flight so you are going to need to get the most out of your notebook&amp;#8217;s battery.  I recommend charging your computer before the flight.  It helps if you bring along an extra battery like the one from [Hyper Mac][], but you can get surprising battery run times by lowering your display brightness, disabling any wireless signals like Bluetooth &amp;amp; Wifi and keeping CPU intensive &amp;amp; disk intensive tasks at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also recommend taking a look at [Watts][], it is a Mac program that helps you keep your battery properly exercised so that it gives you the longest and best performance possible.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### No Internet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some flights have Wifi Internet access, but you don&amp;#8217;t need it to get a lot done.  If you have an offline reader or use an app like [Instapaper][] or [ReadItLater][], you can pre-download content to read while you are offline.  I integrate Instapaper with Google Reader and spend some time tagging articles that I&amp;#8217;m interested in reading while in flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also like [Reeder][] which can sync my Google Reader account to my notebook so that I can read the articles while in flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### Comfort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having enough space to be comfortable is tough to achieve and not necessarily possible on all flights, but there are some things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Search for empty flights.  You typically can get an empty seat next to you&lt;br/&gt;
* Opt for the extra leg room seats&lt;br/&gt;
* Look for emergency exit seats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;### Conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a little bit of preparation you can get a lot done on your flight.&lt;/p&gt;
