Shortly after they did launch (four days) they were acquired by AOL.  Paul Hontz from the &lt;a href="http://thestartupfoundry.com/2011/02/12/why-about-me-was-acquired-by-aol-for-millions-four-days-after-launch/"&gt;Startup Foundry&lt;/a&gt; wrote a great &lt;a href="http://thestartupfoundry.com/2011/02/12/why-about-me-was-acquired-by-aol-for-millions-four-days-after-launch/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; detailing how they were able to pull off such a quick exit.  It makes for a good read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the author&amp;#8217;s points on why they were so successful at attracting users, they also allowed users to reserve their username prior to the launch of the service.  Given the importance of getting your name in the URL, users jumped on the opportunity and this built momentum toward their launch.&lt;/p&gt;
