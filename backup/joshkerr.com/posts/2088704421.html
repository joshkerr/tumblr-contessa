What separates PlatformPro from other standard wordpress themes is the amount of customization that you can perform from the Wordpress admin section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theme itself isn&amp;#8217;t so much a theme, but a whole layer of user interface controls which can be easily manipulated via a very simple control panel.  This powerful functionality allows you to take a simple Wordpress blog and add features like:  &lt;img height="253" width="470" alt="dragdrop2.jpeg" border="0" src="http://feeds.joshkerr.com/wp-content/uploads/Articlesdragdrop2.jpeg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal sidebars, carousels, &lt;a href="http://www.pagelines.com/demos/platformpro/features"&gt;feature boxes&lt;/a&gt; and much more.  I can&amp;#8217;t stress how easy it is to put together and manage a very powerful and professional looking website with PlatformPro.  Now while all of this sounds great, the PlatformPro product is fairly new and there are a few bugs here and there.  The people at PageLines have been quick to fix them with new releases and upgrading your installation is pretty easy using the built in theme upgrade functionality within Wordpress 3.  I&amp;#8217;m using PlatformPro on several websites now and I&amp;#8217;m pretty happy with it.  For more information check out the &lt;a href="http://www.pagelines.com/"&gt;PageLines web site&lt;/a&gt;.  It costs $95 and requires Wordpress 3.0 and above with PHP version 5 and above.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>web</tag><tag>design</tag><tag>development</tag><tag>wordpress</tag></post>
