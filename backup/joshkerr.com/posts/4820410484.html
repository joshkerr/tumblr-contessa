&lt;p&gt;If you try to register or download the software from a computer within the US you are greeted with this lovely message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Spotify – Premium, Unlimited, Open - Music Site - Online Music.jpg" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Spotify-%E2%80%93-Premium-Unlimited-Open-Music-Site-Online-Music.jpg" border="0" alt="Spotify  Premium Unlimited Open  Music Site  Online Music" width="484" height="170"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you live in Europe and you happen to be visiting the US?  What if you need access to the software from outside the UK?  Well, it turns out that you can.  Even from within the US.  So how does a US person access the service?  Well, by pretending you live in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was able to activate the service both on my computer and my iPhone.  I listen to it all the time and it works perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Spotify.jpg" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Spotify.jpg" border="0" alt="Spotify" width="550" height="284"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the only reason Spotify doesn&amp;#8217;t work in the US is that they haven&amp;#8217;t secured the licensing required to operate here.  I imagine that sometime this year they will secure the rights and launch the service.  Rumors suggest this will happen sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to get Spotify in the US&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you need to create a Spotify account.  To do this you will need to fool Spotify in thinking that you are coming from a UK server.  I used a Proxy server to do this.  There are a ton on the Internet, just do a Google search for &amp;#8220;UK Proxy server&amp;#8221; and you&amp;#8217;ll find one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used this one: &lt;a href="http://www.daveproxy.co.uk/"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.daveproxy.co.uk/"&gt;http://www.daveproxy.co.uk/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Browse to the Spotify site and create a new account.  Make sure to choose the free service (they won&amp;#8217;t let you buy a subscription.  More on that later.)  Once you have your account, it is time to download the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the same proxy, download and install the desktop software.  For the iPhone software we are going to need a new iTunes account.  No problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launch iTunes and select the iTunes Store.  At the bottom you should see a link to change country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="iTunes.jpg" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/iTunes.jpg" border="0" alt="ITunes" width="550" height="177"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click it and register a new account.  I used a UK address I found in google.  It doesn&amp;#8217;t matter which one you use, you aren&amp;#8217;t going to add a credit card or use this account for anything other than downloading the client.  Make sure to use a real email account that isn&amp;#8217;t already associated with another iTunes account.  You will need to activate the account via email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not add a credit card to your iTunes Account.  When you are done created it, activate your account via email.  Now you should be able to download the Spotify client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sync it to your iPhone.  Now comes the last step.  You need to upgrade to a Premium subscription in order to use the iPhone client.  You are going to need to hop on to Ebay and purchase a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchased mine from eleanor_1257.  This person responded really quickly and within a few minutes I had my premium account.  You&amp;#8217;ll need to give away your login so that they can login and activate your account via their UK credit card.  Since I didn&amp;#8217;t have any personal information in my spotify account, I had no problem doing that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="SPOTIFY UNLIMITED ONE MONTH WORLDWIDE ACCESS - eBay (item 170615085862 end time Apr-12-11 03_12_02 PDT).jpg" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/SPOTIFY-UNLIMITED-ONE-MONTH-WORLDWIDE-ACCESS-eBay-item-170615085862-end-time-Apr-12-11-03_12_02-PDT.jpg" border="0" alt="SPOTIFY UNLIMITED ONE MONTH WORLDWIDE ACCESS  eBay  item 170615085862 end time Apr 12 11 03 12 02 PDT" width="550" height="258"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend the Spotify service.  It is a great way to enjoy a massive amount of music without needing to shell out an arm and a leg.  Consider me satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
