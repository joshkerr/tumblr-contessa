Add two hard drives.</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;I have a Macbook Pro which has 8gigs of RAM, a super fast processor, and runs dog slow.  Knowing that the bottle neck is usually the HD, I went out and bought an SSD drive to replace the existing HD.  This worked for a little bit until the SSD became too fragmented from lack of TRIM support.  Now my notebook is slower than it was with a regular HD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some research and learned that SSD drives are great for boot devices, but not so good as scratch devices.  Ahhh.   So now I know what to do.  I quickly ordered an OWC &lt;a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/DDAMBS0GB/"&gt;data doubler&lt;/a&gt; which would let me mount a second HD where my optical drive is.  (I never use my optical drive.)   I used &lt;a href="http://diglloydtools.com/disktester.html"&gt;disk tester&lt;/a&gt; to recondition my SSD drive.  Lastly I reconfigured my OS to put the /Users folder on my 2nd HD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#8217;ve got a small but fast &lt;a href="http://www.intel.com/design/flash/nand/productinformation.htm"&gt;intel&lt;/a&gt; SSD drive as a boot device.  I have a 750gig 7200rpm drive as my scratch device (it holds my /Users folder.)  The computer screams.  Its never been this fast.  If I get any requests, I&amp;#8217;ll post the instructions so that you can do this yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
