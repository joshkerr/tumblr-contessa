It is a powerful editor with a big community of users who contribute useful scripts to extend its capabilities. &lt;a href="http://macromates.com/"&gt;Textmate&lt;/a&gt; is very much a &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; editor and something that you can use with not much of a learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/6VEXb.png" alt="VIM Editor"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few colleagues who use VIM, but the few times I&amp;#8217;ve tried it I ended up uninstalling it because it is WAY too complicated.  It goes against everything that I&amp;#8217;ve been doing for the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#8217;ve become more and more envious of those that use VIM and the awesome power it has to make seemly complicated tasks seem simple.  I decided to try it out for a week and see if I can latch on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 10 years ago I decided to stop drinking coffee with lots of sugar and milk and instead drink it black.  It took me two weeks of drinking black coffee before I started to prefer it that way.   Now, I can&amp;#8217;t imagine coffee any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the cold turkey approach, I am now going to start using VIM exclusively as my text editor.  I refuse to launch &lt;a href="http://macromates.com/"&gt;Textmate&lt;/a&gt; for anything, instead I&amp;#8217;m going to clumsily navigate my way through VIM.  By the end of two weeks I should either be signing its praises or furious about my lost of productivity.  I&amp;#8217;m guessing the former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://macvim.org/"&gt;MacVim&lt;/a&gt; seems to be the logical choice for VIM on the Mac.  It is a true cocoa Mac app wrapper for VIM and seems to incorporate a lot of Mac like features into it.  For example, cmd-s to save.  I&amp;#8217;m also using a VIM distro of plugins and scripts called &lt;a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus"&gt;Janus&lt;/a&gt; which gives me a really quick and easy way to configure VIM with the most popular options.  &lt;a href="https://github.com/carlhuda/janus"&gt;Janus&lt;/a&gt; is distributed on Github making it very easy to update it as more features and fixes are introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
