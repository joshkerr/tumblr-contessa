It even made &lt;a href="http://news.worldofapple.com/archives/2006/12/17/zfs-file-system-makes-it-to-mac-os-x-leopard/"&gt;an appearance&lt;/a&gt; in Disk Utility in a beta of Mac OS X 10.5 (pictured right). Although ZFS support was never included in Leopard, it was initially hinted in Snow Leopard Server documentation in 2008 before being removed prior to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Apple had seemingly ceased all work on ZFS claiming the project had been “discontinued.” Today &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/01/31/zfs-comes-to-os-x-courtesy-of-apples-former-chief-zfs-architect/"&gt;pointed us&lt;/a&gt; to a 2011&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/03/how-zfs-is-slowly-making-its-way-to-mac-os-x.ars"&gt;article profiling&lt;/a&gt; an Apple engineer named Don Brady who worked on the ZFS team at Apple until 2009. The report noted “&lt;em&gt;Apple couldn’t reach suitable license terms with Sun” &lt;/em&gt;at the time, and Brady eventually left to form his own company in 2010 called Ten’s Complement. Two years later, Brady and Ten’s Complement are bringing ZFS support to Mac OS X with the company’s latest project, &lt;a href="http://tenscomplement.com/our-products/zevo-silver-edition"&gt;ZEVO &lt;em&gt;Silver Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Silver Edition is just the first product from Ten’s Complement and includes basic ZFS support for $19.95. Other products will follow including a &lt;a href="http://tenscomplement.com/our-products/zevo-gold-edition"&gt;$40 Gold Edition&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://tenscomplement.com/our-products/zevo-platinum-edition"&gt;Platinum Edition&lt;/a&gt; with support for RAIDZ and other advanced features. A &lt;a href="http://tenscomplement.com/our-products/zevo-developer-edition"&gt;Developer Edition&lt;/a&gt; will provide devs with “convetional ZFS command line tools”, GUI options, and customization options. As &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;pointed out, the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/maczfs/"&gt;MacZFS open source project&lt;/a&gt; is also continuing development on the original work done by Sun and Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
