When I&amp;#8217;m not using &lt;a href="http://www.cortexapp.com"&gt;Cortex&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m using &lt;a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/ia-writer-for-mac/"&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt; and a ruby script to send my content to Tumblr without even opening a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cortexapp.com"&gt;Cortex&lt;/a&gt; is great for resubmitting other user&amp;#8217;s content via the web, but when it comes to writing your own articles, forget it.  This is where &lt;a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/ia-writer-for-mac/"&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt; comes in.  This app is designed for writing, it allows you to focus on the words (think full screen editor) and it has great markdown support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t easily submit articles from a text editor (unless you&amp;#8217;ve rigged up support in Textmate) so you need to setup a script to send your posts for you.  Here is mine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
#!/bin/bash
IFS=$(echo -en "\n\b")
cd "~/Dropbox/Blog/BlogArticles/"
set `ls -t -r | tail -n 1`
echo "$1"
tumblr -c ~/.tumblrlogin "$1"
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m using a ruby gem: &amp;#8212;tumblr-rb&amp;#8212; and have it setup with my Tumblr blogs username and password in my ~/.tumblrlogin file.  More on the gem&amp;#8217;s man pages about configuring the gem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The script is simple.  It looks for the most recent post in my blog article directory and submits it.  In my post, I&amp;#8217;ve got YAML config items that allow me to control where the post goes: queue, drafts, published, etc..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
title: post title
type: regular
format: markdown
state: published
tags: tag1,tag2,tag3
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I write and save the posts in my blog directory and then execute my script to send them up to Tumblr.  If I wanted I could rig the script to open the browser and go right to the post (the ruby gem returns the post ID after a successful post.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could do a lot more with it, but for now it is getting the job done.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>tips</tag><tag>featured</tag></post>
