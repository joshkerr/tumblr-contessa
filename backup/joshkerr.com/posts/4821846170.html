&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was visual communications student back in the day, I bought a 70’s-era Canon rangefinder on eBay for $50 because I’d read that they were similar to the classic Leica M’s, which I’d never be able to afford. I loved it and I learned to be a better photographer because of the constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, dealing with film became a non-starter as everything went digital so I gave it to a buddy but I’ve long pined for a nice digital rangefinder. Epson made and discontinued one a few years ago that took Leica lenses, Leica of course built digital M’s still priced out of my reach and there are a few other fixed focal length kits out there but nothing has really turned my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/technology/personaltech/21pogue.html?nl=technology&amp;amp;pagewanted=all"&gt;Fuji X100&lt;/a&gt;, though. Hoo, boy, now that looks like something, doesn’t it? Beautiful build, manual knobs, a fast f/2 35-mm equivalent lens, an optional TTL viewfinder mode, HD video and a few other tricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like it has a few quirks but this is the first digital rangefinder that I’ve gotten excited about.&lt;/p&gt;
