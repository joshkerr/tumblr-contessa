At least not yet. For the past six months, I&amp;#8217;ve gone without a TV. It is an experiment to see if I can satisfy my TV watching with downloadable content from the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of iTunes, &lt;a href="http://http://www.netflix.com"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://http://hulu.com"&gt;Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, I can watch enough TV to be satisfied. The only real thing I miss is live sporting events. This will be the first year that I don&amp;#8217;t watch the super-bowl live. I will watch it after it gets posted online, but for the live event, I&amp;#8217;m missing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tough part for me is not going to ESPN.com and looking up the score. In the end, it will be impossible for me not to know the outcome of the game before I end up watching it. I&amp;#8217;ll try to hold out as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cable TV, beware. I&amp;#8217;m happy without you, so you&amp;#8217;ll need to retool and add some significant value before I come back.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
