In order to improve the speed and efficiency of writing blog articles, created a syntax language for writing HTML formatted documents called &lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt;.   (&lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Read more about Markdown&lt;/a&gt; He also wrote a basic parser which will convert the Markdown document into HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big advantage of Markdown is that it is easier to write than HTML code because it does not require end tags and the syntax is simpler.  You will however need some kind of converter to translate the Markdown into HTML in order to gain any sort of benefit of writing in it.  For me, the goal was a more powerful way to write my blog articles in Wordpress without resorting to HTML.  To do this, I found a good Markdown to HTML &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/markdown-for-wordpress-and-bbpress/"&gt;plugin&lt;/a&gt; for Wordpress and fired up &lt;a href="http://macromates.com/"&gt;Textmate&lt;/a&gt; (my editor of choice) to compose my blog articles.  Textmate has built in support for working with Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title="Textmate" alt="Markdown in Textmate" src="http://j.mp/dhFGDS"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Markdown code in Textmate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/"&gt;Mars Edit 3&lt;/a&gt; is the best WYSIWYG blog editor for the Mac in my opinion.  It also has support for Markdown, but it will not do syntax highlighting as BBEDIT for Textmate will.  It will also convert your Markdown into HTML if you switch the editor from HTML view to Rich Text view.  You will need to select the &lt;strong&gt;Markdown&lt;/strong&gt; text filter in the preview window to get the preview to format correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Selecting the markdown preview filter" src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/Change%20parsers.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the Markdown preview filter to get your formatting to look right&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mars Edit will let you select an external editor to edit your blog posts so if you choose Textmate you can write your articles in Textmate and then post them with Mars Edit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Mars Edit Preferences with Textmate selected" src="http://j.mp/9AhGCu"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mars Edit preferences with Textmate selected as the external editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a lot of work just to get your blog article published and for most people it is, but if you are writing technical articles that have code, formatting, or lots of images, Markdown can really save you time in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>tip</tag><tag>wordpress</tag></post>
