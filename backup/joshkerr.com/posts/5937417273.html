&lt;p&gt;News outlets recently published the contents of the black box from the ill fated Air France flight 447 that crashed into the ocean after mysteriously dropping out of the sky.  The news reported that the cause of the crash was related to ice formed on sensors that measure airspeed.  Case closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/447730-af447-wreckage-found-27.html"&gt;PPRuNE&lt;/a&gt; is a professional pilots rumor network and it has a great  forum where pilots discuss issues like the Air France 447 crash.  The opinions from these professional pilots seem to indicate that the mystery is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several pilots bring into question the actions of the seasoned flight screw whose actions go against not only their training but common sense.  For example, one pilot discusses the fact that the Air France co-pilot kept the plane in a nose up position even though the plane was clearly stalled.  Doing so would only make the stall worse.  Not only were the alarms ringining in the cockpit, but you could feel the vibrations of the stall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From a pilot on the forums:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m rather disturbed that far from applying the pitch/power memory items, he chose to pitch up instead whilst encountering STALL warnings no less!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And another:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t see why the AP pitched UP due to reducing airspeed. Worse still, it seems clear to me that the pilots had several STALL warnings after AP disengagement and prior to it actually dropping like a brick. What is even more perplexing is given that the pilot arrested the 7000 ft rate of climb, why he then proceeded to apply aft stick input and raise the nose?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the case is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>opinion</tag></post>
