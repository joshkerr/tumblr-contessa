Each co-founder brings a different set of skills to the table and it is critical that each co-founder’s role is clearly defined and that you set agreeable goals otherwise your startup is doom to fail. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;img height="375" width="600" alt="Snow Leopard Prowl.jpg" border="0" src="http://feeds.joshkerr.com/wp-content/uploads/Snow-Leopard-Prowl.jpg" title="Snow Leopard Prowl.jpg"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cheetah hunts alone.  His role is clearly defined: Hunt.  His goal: get some dinner.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Right from the beginning, each co-founder will wear different hats.  Some will be responsible for development, some for marketing, some for business development and others for investor relations.  These areas of responsibility should be placed into clearly defined roles with attached goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What role will you play in your new startup?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For example let’s say we define the role of marketing to include public relations and social network out reach.  The goal for the first three months could be to establish a social marketing presence and attain 600 twitter followers and 1000 views to the company’s website.  This marketing role now has a goal and can be assigned to one of the co-founders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each role should be assigned to the person with the best chance for success.  At the end of the first month the group should review the performance of each person and decide on whether the roles need to be changed, goals need to be adjusted or if that person needs to be removed all together from their assigned role. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Consider this comment by Bob, a co-founder who was assigned with the aforementioned marking role:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&amp;#8220;Hey it wasn&amp;#8217;t my fault that we only got 230 twitter followers even though our goal was 600.  John didn&amp;#8217;t do enough Tweeting.&amp;#8221;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actually, it was your fault that you only received 230 twitter followers.  You own the marketing role.  You should&amp;#8217;ve done everything in your power to make sure that you hit your numbers.  If John isn&amp;#8217;t helping, find someone else who will or do it yourself. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The other key element to roles is delineating clear authority with regard to decision making.   The co-founders should decide the extent to which each person&amp;#8217;s role can make decisions without needing the permission from the group.  This is paramount as it will facilitate much faster iteration.  Every time the co-founders need to meet to make a decision, they waste time so allowing Bob the authority to run a promotion to acquire more twitter users could&amp;#8217;ve allowed him to hit his goal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this formula in place, the company will have its best chance for success.  It will also place clear responsibility, ownership, and authority with each of the co-founders and provide a good way to reward future success or punish failure.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>Startup</tag><tag>tips</tag></post>
