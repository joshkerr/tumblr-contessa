I am not in love with Time Machine.  Time Machine is a resource hog, it has no configuration options (save for hacking the command line,) and it results in a non-bootable backup.  This means that you&amp;#8217;ll need to reinstall your OS, then restore from Time Machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SuperDuper! makes these pains go away.  First, the app creates a bootable image of your current Mac&amp;#8217;s disk.  This means if you ever run into a problem, you can simply boot from an external drive (with that image) and you are back in business.  Buy a new hard drive, clone the image right to that drive.  It couldn&amp;#8217;t be more flexible and I love it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/SuperDuper!.png" alt="SuperDuperImage"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SuperDuper! is easy to setup with minimal options.  Just choose the drive to backup and the drive to save the image to.  It could take quite a while to do a full backup, but after the first backup, you can have it to differential backups so that each followup backup goes faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, Time Machine is disabled and SuperDuper! is keeping me safe.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
