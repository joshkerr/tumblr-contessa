&lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/tag/samsung"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t letting CES go by without introducing a few new accessories for its mobile devices. A pair of Bluetooth headsets are on tap, the HM1800 and HM6000 (the latter of which boasts a pair of mics for noise cancellation ) but, oddly enough, it the company&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;your sound&amp;#8221; wired models that are getting the bulk of the attention. The EHS-60, 63, 70 and 71 all offer a twist on the wired stereo headset model. The high-end 70 and 71 are crafted of aluminum and include welcome features like anti-tangle cords. The most interesting, though, are certainly the EHS-63s which feature an in-ear speaker for higher frequencies and an open-air, over-ear one for low-end. Check out the PR after the break.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
