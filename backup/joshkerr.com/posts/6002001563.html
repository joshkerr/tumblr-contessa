It used to be bundled with new Mac purchases as part of the Apple Care warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/6pDCK.jpg" alt="TechTool"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best features in the product is its ability to boot from a DVD and repair your system.  Ever since the release of EFI firmware Macs, the bootable DVD hasn&amp;#8217;t worked.  Now, with the release of Tech Tool Pro version 6, you can create an e-drive bootable partition on your Mac and repair without needing a DVD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;#8217;t tried it yet, but its the logical next step in bootable diagnostics, especially considering the future of computing doesn&amp;#8217;t have an optical media drive.  Take for instance that new Macbook Airs come with media on a USB stick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see problems with the bootable partition scheme though.  What if you need to repair the drive with the bootable partition?  Maybe you boot off a clone on an external drive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also new with Tech Tool Pro 6 is a cloning feature.  I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of cloning, it keeps a fully working disk on hand so that if I do have a failure, I can boot in seconds off the clone and keep on working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a copy of Tech Tool 6 and plan to take it through its paces.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>interesting</tag></post>
