They choose the most promising idea and try to get it off the ground.  If the project is successful, the company continues to grow after the 3 days.  Either way, its great experience for the students and encourages a lot of great ideas.  The program organized a series of guest speakers including Brett Hurt CEO of Bazzarvoice, Joshua Baer CEO of Otherinbox.  I&amp;#8217;m the last of the speakers to go and I&amp;#8217;m going to be talking about my experiences both successes and more importantly failures.  I&amp;#8217;m also going to talk about why I love what I do and what I see for myself in the future.  There will be some Q&amp;amp;A (probably a lot of it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was a UT computer science student in the early 90&amp;#8217;s and I haven&amp;#8217;t been back to the computer science campus since I graduated.  So this will be a bit of a homecoming for me.  I&amp;#8217;m reminded of when I was a marketing student and in my junior year decided I wanted to change my major to computer science.  My advisor told me that I was unfit to be a computer science student and I should just stay the course.  I argued and she unwillingly let me into the program.  Little did she know that I would thrive in the program and go on to greater success.  Tomorrow should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>speaker</tag><tag>Startup</tag></post>
