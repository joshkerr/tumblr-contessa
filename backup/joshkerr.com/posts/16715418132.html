&lt;p&gt;The style of the Apple store is unmistakeable. With wooden tables and mostly clear acrylic displays, all the shiny Macs and iPads and iPhones on display can be seen in all their glory. Why not bring a bit of that simplistic display home with you so your gadgets can look just as awesome? Of course, I’m not encouraging you to steal from the Apple store. &lt;a href="http://newmacgadgets.com/products/apple_headphone_stand/index.html#"&gt;NewMacgadets.com&lt;/a&gt; has some really neat display options that mimic those found in the Apple store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not long ago we showed you the &lt;a href="http://newpcgadgets.com/products/ipad_pedestal/index-1.html#"&gt;iPad 2 display docks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://forums.imore.com/ipad-accessories/226741-giveaway-ipad-2-display-dock-enter-win-1-10-a.html"&gt;gave a few away&lt;/a&gt; to some lucky iMore readers. Today we wanted to show you the Headphone Stand, created to look identical to the ones at your favorite store. Constructed from 1/2″ clear acrylic with non-slip feet and a stainless steel arm, you can conveniently hold your headphones where they will always be easily accessible. Reduce clutter on your desk without adding anything obtrusive. You can pick these up for $29.95 at &lt;a href="http://newmacgadgets.com/products/apple_headphone_stand/index.html#"&gt;newMacgadgets.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
