&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/nschon"&gt;Gov. Nick Schonberger&lt;/a&gt; told me this is the best thing he’s seen all day when I shared this one with him. It is about the best way to end of a week, I say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dog lounger from &lt;a href="http://www.vurv.ca/"&gt;Vurv Design&lt;/a&gt; (Canada, represent)  is a curve plywood gem, veneered in walnut and ready set fo your dog to literally lap in luxury. The circular three-quarter form by itself is a work of beauty which as a standalone works. Turning that design into a functional crawl space for your dog or cat just make it more interested, though I can already tell my Chere would need a bit more cush to relax in there.  The best part?  $&lt;a href="http://www.etsy.com/listing/86291143/dog-pod-lounge-walnut"&gt;598&lt;/a&gt; with free shipping inside the USA or Canada. Made in Canada, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were not a bit jealous of your dog’s lax life beforehand, you may now.&lt;/p&gt;
