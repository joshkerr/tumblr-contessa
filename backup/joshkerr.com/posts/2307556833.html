PGP vs FileVault</regular-title><regular-body>&lt;p&gt;I just got done with encrypting my notebook&amp;#8217;s 500GB  hard drive.  It took a little over 6 hours to for PGP to encrypt the whole drive.  I have a Mac so I had the option to use FileVault the built in encryption service, but chose instead to use PGP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pgp.png" alt="Encrypting my hard drive"/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For me, the big differentiator is that FileVault only encrypts your home folder.  There are so many ways that data can get outside your home folder and that is a glaring security hole. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These are the advantages to PGP Whole Disk Encryption over FileVault: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time Machine Backup&amp;#8217;s run whilst user is logged into home folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You get some extra tools (eg to encrypt external drives.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t need to worry about sensitive data getting outside of the home folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can use the computer while the disk is encrypting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your swap file and sleep image are encrypted automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No extra waiting during shutdown for FileVault optimizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big advantage of FileVault over PGP WDE is that FileVault is an Apple created technology and will be compatible with future versions of Mac OS X where PGP might not.  Recently users who upgraded to 10.6.5 found their computers unable to boot due to a last minute change made by Apple before the release.  PGP was quick to fix the issue and nobody lost data, but the thought of waiting for a rescue boot disk to use your notebook again is pretty scary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider myself a power user and I was initially worried about performance.  WDE is not supposed to cause any noticeable performance hit to your notebook in normal usage.  (What ever that means.)  For me, I notice that the startup times are a bit longer, but everything else is just as zippy fast as it was before WDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I travel quite a bit and feel reassured that my notebook is protected especially in the event of a theft.  If you have the extra cash, I recommend PGP Whole Disk Encryption over using FileVault as it provides a much more secure way to keep your data safe.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>security</tag><tag>tips</tag><tag>technology</tag></post>
