There were 10 different groups each presenting a company that they had incubated over the weekend.  The ideas were mostly good, some were downright hilarious and a few seemed to have legs.  I don&amp;#8217;t know that I&amp;#8217;d go out and invest in any one of them, but I&amp;#8217;d certainly consider taking equity in return for a role as an advisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hosted the event in their new offices in North Austin and they did a great job providing a forum for these entrepreneurs to work in.  Many came from outside of Austin, Dallas, San Antonio and even one guy from Oklahoma.  Most had day jobs and a few were actually fairly successful and looking for something a bit more challenging that their usual routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was fun and in the end we had to choose a winner.  Not easy, but that is the way the game works.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
