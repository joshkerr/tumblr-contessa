I was recently at the Lego store in my local mall with my kids buying them Legos, the little building blocks that I loved as a kid.  They haven&amp;#8217;t changed much over the years, but I found myself falling in love with them all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter loves Star Wars something she certainly got from me and they had the Imperial Shuttle Craft and it was really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#8217;t buy it, but I plan to go back and get it.  I mean, how awesome does that thing look?  My kids are all over Legos now so I&amp;#8217;ve got a great excuse to play with them too.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body></post>
