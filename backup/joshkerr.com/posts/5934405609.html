You&amp;#8217;ve spent over $400 buying content from the iTunes store.  Videos, music, apps all delivered to your computer&amp;#8217;s hard drive via a one time download.  Then, the unexpected happens.  Its all gone.  Somehow you lost your content.  Maybe it was hard drive failure, maybe your kid accidentally deleted the folder to make room to install Portal 2.  Either way, it is gone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what do you do?  Don&amp;#8217;t fear, Apple will let you download it again.  Simply go to the iTunes support page, fill out a support ticket and explain the situation.  They will re-queue all of your paid content so that the next time you load iTunes, you&amp;#8217;ll have your $400 worth of downloads waiting to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with this nice recovery options from a very generous Apple, I still recommend backing up your content.  For me its a combination of Drobo with Time Machine and an offsite Amazon S3 account via Jungle Disk.&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>tips</tag></post>
