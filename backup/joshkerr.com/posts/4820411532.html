I spent some time walking through the different booths and came away with a feeling that there isn&amp;#8217;t much innovation happening in the industry.  There is a strong push toward the cloud and cloud based security, but from a security technology perspective, you&amp;#8217;ve got the same techniques applied to updated hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m no security expert, actually far from it, so my first job was to find out what RSA stands for.  I asked four different attendees and not a single one knew.  I ended up Googling it and learned that it stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, the inventors of the algorithm for public key encryption.  Like those that I quizzed, it is doubtful that I will commit those names to memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke to many different people representing all types of big enterprise, from government defense to banking to IT consulting.  Most were looking for new ways to improve their security, trying to lower the costs of fraud and information leakage.  I didn&amp;#8217;t see anything at the conference that indicates that consumers or businesses will be any safer in the coming years.  In fact, I&amp;#8217;d go so far to say that as we become more dependent on wireless devices for transactions such as payment, we&amp;#8217;ll become even more vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;
