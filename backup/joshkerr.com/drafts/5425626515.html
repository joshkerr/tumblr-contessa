Thats when I received my first camera, a Minolta Maxxum 5000 which was a workhorse of a camera and would last me many years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1304911936.jpg" alt="myTumblr Image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high school I took my first photography classes which included darkroom work and became enamored with sports photography, so I joined the school newspaper eventually becoming photo editor.  I was also the photo editor of my high school year book, but when I entered college, my interests shifted toward music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years post college and I started to travel around the world and photography became interesting again.  Around this time the digital SLR’s were becoming more popular and affordable.  For me, the dream camera was the Nikon D1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1304911972.jpg" alt="myTumblr Image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a little more and I&amp;#8217;ve assembled what I believe to be the dream team of cameras.  There are three cameras that stand out for a variety of reasons: The Fuji Film X100, Canon 5d Mark II and the Leica M9.   These cameras are not cheap, and but my success in business has afforded me the luxury of being able to afford them, something I&amp;#8217;m very grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Canon 5D Mark II is the oldest of the bunch.  This camera came out in February 2009 and was the first lightweight full frame digital camera.  It was also the first camera to shoot 1080p video with quality that rivaled the top digital film making cameras.  It could shoot in low light situations and sold for a relatively low price compared to professional video cameras.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1304912281.jpg" alt="myTumblr Image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought this camera to shoot film, but a few years later would start to experiment with film.  The camera is fantastic in so many ways.  It is so easy to use and at the same time, so powerful.  The photos come out looking unbelievable, probably the best of any digital camera in its class.  This is my action camera.  I shoot my kids, sports, animals in nature, racing, anything that moves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#8217;ve also started using it to shoot film.  It is tough to transition from photos to film with this camera because there is no autofocus while using the video feature.  So you need to follow focus which is a skill that can take years to master.  I&amp;#8217;m not very good at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up is the Fuji Film X100.  This camera is brand new, but I&amp;#8217;ve added it to this list because the camera transcends what camera makers have been doing for the past 10 years.  I don’t know what kind of drugs Fuji designers were on when they created this thing, but it is decidedly different.  Rather than build another next gen future looking camera, Fuji went total retro.  They took some pretty impressive technology and packed it into this 1970’s looking range finder camera body with a chrome metal &amp;amp; black finish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1304912854.jpg" alt="myTumblr Image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camera is amazing in so many ways.  First it feels so good in your hand.  Heavy, solid, very much like a camera from a long time ago built by hand by German craftsman.  This does not feel like a Japanese camera.  The view finder is an optical view finder which means you see the world through a lens, not an LCD screen.  Fuji innovated and created a heads up display that is digital projected on top of the optical viewfinder.  It works great and makes this little beauty quite a technical marvel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The X100 is so much fun to use.  The leaf shutter is quiet so you can sneak up on your subjects shooting them without them even knowing it.  The camera performs well and the photos look good probably because of its full frame sensor and 23mm F2 fixed lens.  Good luck buying one though, this is the hottest camera to come out this year and Fuji can’t make them fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but certainly not least is my Leica M9.  This camera is without a doubt the best camera I&amp;#8217;ve ever owned.  By far.  Leica as a brand is world famous for quality, their cameras and even their literature are collectables.  Their lens are the best and the only company I know of whose product from the 1930&amp;#8217;s can be used on a modem camera today with outstanding results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The range finder camera is not an easy camera to use.  The focusing is a challenge and the composition of images is done not through the lens, but through the range finder so you really need to get to know your camera.   I usually shoot with a Leica 35mm F1.4 ASPH lens which is a good all around lens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myTumblr_Image_1304913653.jpg" alt="myTumblr Image"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;p&amp;gt;The reason I&amp;#8217;m so in love with this camera is the images it produces.  I don&amp;#8217;t know how it does it, but it regularly produces images that make me gasp.  The color, cript quality of the image, even the bokeh, all superb.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>photography</tag><tag>featured</tag></post>
